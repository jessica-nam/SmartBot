                "You are a victim of branch prediction fail.Consider a railroad junction:Image by Mecanismo, via Wikimedia Commons. Used under the CC-By-SA 3.0 license.Now for the sake of argument, suppose this is back in the 1800s - before long-distance or radio communication.You are a blind operator of a junction and you hear a train coming. You have no idea which way it is supposed to go. You stop the train to ask the driver which direction they want. And then you set the switch appropriately.Trains are heavy and have a lot of inertia, so they take forever to start up and slow down.Is there a better way? You guess which direction the train will go!If you guess right every time, the train will never have to stop.\nIf you guess wrong too often, the train will spend a lot of time stopping, backing up, and restarting.Consider an if-statement: At the processor level, it is a branch instruction:You are a processor and you see a branch. You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path.Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines. This means they take forever to \"warm up\" and \"slow down\".Is there a better way? You guess which direction the branch will go!If you guess right every time, the execution will never have to stop.\nIf you guess wrong too often, you spend a lot of time stalling, rolling back, and restarting.This is branch prediction. I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.How would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path? You look at the past history! If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same...In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it. This is more or less how branch predictors work.Most applications have well-behaved branches. Therefore, modern branch predictors will typically achieve >90% hit rates. But when faced with unpredictable branches with no recognizable patterns, branch predictors are virtually useless.Further reading: \"Branch predictor\" article on Wikipedia.Notice that the data is evenly distributed between 0 and 255. When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement.This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction.Quick visualization:However, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can't predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing).What can be done?If the compiler isn't able to optimize the branch into a conditional move, you can try some hacks if you are willing to sacrifice readability for performance.Replace:with:This eliminates the branch and replaces it with some bitwise operations.(Note that this hack is not strictly equivalent to the original if-statement. But in this case, it's valid for all the input values of data[].)Benchmarks: Core i7 920 @ 3.5 GHzC++ - Visual Studio 2010 - x64 ReleaseJava - NetBeans 7.1.1 JDK 7 - x64Observations:A general rule of thumb is to avoid data-dependent branching in critical loops (such as in this example).Update:GCC 4.6.1 with -O3 or -ftree-vectorize on x64 is able to generate a conditional move, so there is no difference between the sorted and unsorted data - both are fast.(Or somewhat fast: for the already-sorted case, cmov can be slower especially if GCC puts it on the critical path instead of just add, especially on Intel before Broadwell where cmov has 2 cycle latency: gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2)VC++ 2010 is unable to generate conditional moves for this branch even under /Ox.Intel C++ Compiler (ICC) 11 does something miraculous. It interchanges the two loops, thereby hoisting the unpredictable branch to the outer loop. Not only is it immune to the mispredictions, it's also twice as fast as whatever VC++ and GCC can generate! In other words, ICC took advantage of the test-loop to defeat the benchmark...If you give the Intel compiler the branchless code, it just outright vectorizes it... and is just as fast as with the branch (with the loop interchange).This goes to show that even mature modern compilers can vary wildly in their ability to optimize code...",
                "Branch prediction.With a sorted array, the condition data[c] >= 128 is first false for a streak of values, then becomes true for all later values. That's easy to predict. With an unsorted array, you pay for the branching cost.",
                "The reason why performance improves drastically when the data is sorted is that the branch prediction penalty is removed, as explained beautifully in Mysticial's answer.Now, if we look at the codewe can find that the meaning of this particular if... else... branch is to add something when a condition is satisfied. This type of branch can be easily transformed into a conditional move statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: cmovl, in an x86 system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed.In C, thus C++, the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in x86, is the ternary operator ... ? ... : .... So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one:While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor.On an Intel Core i7-2600K @ 3.4\u00a0GHz and Visual Studio 2010 Release Mode, the benchmark is:x86x64The result is robust in multiple tests. We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern.Now let's look more closely by investigating the x86 assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions max1 and max2.max1 uses the conditional branch if... else ...:max2 uses the ternary operator ... ? ... : ...:On an x86-64 machine, GCC -S generates the assembly below.max2 uses much less code due to the usage of instruction cmovge. But the real gain is that max2 does not involve branch jumps, jmp, which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right.So why does a conditional move perform better?In a typical x86 processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called pipelining.In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict.In a conditional move case, the execution of conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like Fetch and Decode do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only the latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy.The book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for Conditional Move Instructions, entire Chapter 4 for Processor Architecture, and Section 5.11.2 for special treatment for Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties.Sometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, and sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between a branch and a conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.",
                "If you are curious about even more optimizations that can be done to this code, consider this:Starting with the original loop:With loop interchange, we can safely change this loop to:Then, you can see that the if conditional is constant throughout the execution of the i loop, so you can hoist the if out:Then, you see that the inner loop can be collapsed into one single expression, assuming the floating point model allows it (/fp:fast is thrown, for example)That one is 100,000 times faster than before.",
                "No doubt some of us would be interested in ways of identifying code that is problematic for the CPU's branch-predictor.

                "I just read up on this question and its answers, and I feel an answer is missing.A common way to eliminate branch prediction that I've found to work particularly good in managed languages is a table lookup instead of using a branch (although I haven't tested it in this case).This approach works in general if:Background and whyFrom a processor perspective, your memory is slow. To compensate for the difference in speed, a couple of caches are built into your processor (L1/L2 cache). So imagine that you're doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get its 'load' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache -- and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this 'load' will slow down your program.Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we've already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever (in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible!).Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well.The first thing we need to know is what is small? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are <= 4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it's probably worth reconsidering.Constructing a tableSo we've figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps multiply). You want to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of 'unique key' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do.In this case: >= 128 means we can keep the value, < 128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an 'AND': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF's.Managed languagesYou might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don't mess up...Well, not exactly... :-)There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example:In this case, it's obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never be hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check altogether. WOW, that means no branch. Similarly, it will deal with other obvious cases.If you run into trouble with lookups in managed languages -- the key is to add a & 0x[something]FFF to your lookup function to make the boundary check predictable -- and watch it going faster.The result of this case",
                "As data is distributed between 0 and 255 when the array is sorted, around the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement (the if statement is shared below).The question is: What makes the above statement not execute in certain cases as in case of sorted data? Here comes the \"branch predictor\". A branch predictor is a digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance!Let's do some bench marking to understand it betterThe performance of an if-statement depends on whether its condition has a predictable pattern. If the condition is always true or always false, the branch prediction logic in the processor will pick up the pattern. On the other hand, if the pattern is unpredictable, the if-statement will be much more expensive.Let\u2019s measure the performance of this loop with different conditions:Here are the timings of the loop with different true-false patterns:A \u201cbad\u201d true-false pattern can make an if-statement up to six times slower than a \u201cgood\u201d pattern! Of course, which pattern is good and which is bad depends on the exact instructions generated by the compiler and on the specific processor.So there is no doubt about the impact of branch prediction on performance!",
                "One way to avoid branch prediction errors is to build a lookup table, and index it using the data.  Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer.But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values >= 128.  That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit.  Let's call this bit the \"decision bit\".By using the 0/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted.  Our code will always add a value, but when the decision bit is 0, we will add the value somewhere we don't care about.  Here's the code:This code wastes half of the adds but never has a branch prediction failure.  It's tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement.But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting.  This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called lut for \"LookUp Table\" in the code).  Here's the C++ code:In this case, the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fits nicely in a cache and all was fast.  This technique wouldn't work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical.  On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table.  For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index.  A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical.The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an if statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use.  I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers (pLeft and pRight or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers and used the \"decision bit\" technique to decide which one to follow.  For example, instead of:this library would do something like:Here's a link to this code: Red Black Trees, Eternally Confuzzled",
                "In the sorted case, you can do better than relying on successful branch prediction or any branchless comparison trick: completely remove the branch.Indeed, the array is partitioned in a contiguous zone with data < 128 and another with data >= 128. So you should find the partition point with a dichotomic search (using Lg(arraySize) = 15 comparisons), then do a straight accumulation from that point.Something like (unchecked)or, slightly more obfuscatedA yet faster approach, that gives an approximate solution for both sorted or unsorted is: sum= 3137536; (assuming a truly uniform distribution, 16384 samples with expected value 191.5) :-)",
                "The above behavior is happening because of Branch prediction.To understand branch prediction one must first understand an Instruction Pipeline.The the steps of running an instruction can be overlapped with the sequence of steps of running the previous and next instruction, so that different steps can be executed concurrently in parallel. This technique is known as instruction pipelining and is used to increase throughput in modern processors. To understand this better please see this example on Wikipedia.Generally, modern processors have quite long (and wide) pipelines, so many instruction can be in flight.  See Modern Microprocessors\nA 90-Minute Guide! which starts by introducing basic in-order pipelining and goes from there.But for ease let's consider a simple in-order pipeline with these 4 steps only.\n(Like a classic 5-stage RISC, but omitting a separate MEM stage.)4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions.Moving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions:Without branch prediction, the following would occur:To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait (stall) till the instruction A leaves the EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A.  (i.e. where to fetch from next.) So the pipeline will look like this:Without prediction: when if condition is true:Without prediction: When if condition is false:As a result of waiting for the result of instruction A, the total CPU cycles spent in the above case (without branch prediction; for both true and false) is 7.So what is branch prediction?Branch predictor will try to guess which way a branch (an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example).In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this:If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay.\nThe time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good branch predictor.In the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. (Or fall back to static prediction, typically forward not-taken, backward taken).  Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history.\nFor an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities:Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run.So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct.\nIn the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly.\nIn the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history.In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles.But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array.Further reading:",
                "An official answer would be fromYou can also see from this lovely diagram why the branch predictor gets confused.Each element in the original code is a random valueso the predictor will change sides as the std::rand() blow.On the other hand, once it's sorted, the predictor will first move into a state of strongly not taken and when the values change to the high value the predictor will in three runs through change all the way from strongly not taken to strongly taken.",
                "In the same line (I think this was not highlighted by any answer) it's good to mention that sometimes (specially in software where the performance matters\u2014like in the Linux kernel) you can find some if statements like the following:or similarly:Both likely() and unlikely() are in fact macros that are defined by using something like the GCC's __builtin_expect to help the compiler insert prediction code to favour the condition taking into account the information provided by the user. GCC supports other builtins that could change the behavior of the running program or emit low level instructions like clearing the cache, etc. See this documentation that goes through the available GCC's builtins.Normally this kind of optimizations are mainly found in hard-real time applications or embedded systems where execution time matters and it's critical. For example, if you are checking for some error condition that only happens 1/10000000 times, then why not inform the compiler about this? This way, by default, the branch prediction would assume that the condition is false.",
                "Frequently used Boolean operations in C++ produce many branches in the compiled program. If these branches are inside loops and are hard to predict they can slow down execution significantly. Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value 0 for false and 1 for true.Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than 0 or 1, but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than 0 or 1. This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary.\nConsider example:This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way:This code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than 0 and 1. The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if a and b has been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this:char is used instead of bool in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators (& and |) instead of the Boolean operators (&& and ||). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (|) works even if a and b have other values than 0 or 1. The AND operator (&) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator (^) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than 0 and 1.~ can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be 0 or 1 by XOR'ing it with 1:can be optimized to:a && b cannot be replaced with a & b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is false ( && will not evaluate b, & will). Likewise, a || b can not be replaced with a | b if b is an expression that should not be evaluated if a is true.Using bitwise operators is more advantageous if the operands are variables than if the operands are comparisons:is optimal in most cases (unless you expect the && expression to generate many branch mispredictions).",
                "That's for sure!...Branch prediction makes the logic run slower, because of the switching which happens in your code! It's like you are going a straight street or a street with a lot of turnings, for sure the straight one is going to be done quicker!...If the array is sorted, your condition is false at the first step: data[c] >= 128, then becomes a true value for the whole way to the end of the street. That's how you get to the end of the logic faster. On the other hand, using an unsorted array, you need a lot of turning and processing which make your code run slower for sure...Look at the image I created for you below. Which street is going to be finished faster?So programmatically, branch prediction causes the process to be slower...Also at the end, it's good to know we have two kinds of branch predictions that each is going to affect your code differently:1.

Still I'd like to draw the group's attention to yet another interesting analysis.Recently this example (modified very slightly) was also used as a way to demonstrate how a piece of code can be profiled within the program itself on Windows. Along the way, the author also shows how to use the results to determine where the code is spending most of its time in both the sorted & unsorted case. Finally the piece also shows how to use a little known feature of the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to determine just how much branch misprediction is happening in the unsorted case.The link is here:\nA Demonstration of Self-Profiling",
                "As what has already been mentioned by others, what behind the mystery is Branch Predictor.I'm not trying to add something but explaining the concept in another way. \nThere is a concise introduction on the wiki which contains text and diagram.\nI do like the explanation below which uses a diagram to elaborate the Branch Predictor intuitively.In computer architecture, a branch predictor is a\n  digital circuit that tries to guess which way a branch (e.g. an\n  if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. The\n  purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the\n  instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in\n  achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined\n  microprocessor architectures such as x86.Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump\n  instruction. A conditional jump can either be \"not taken\" and continue\n  execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately\n  after the conditional jump, or it can be \"taken\" and jump to a\n  different place in program memory where the second branch of code is\n  stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be\n  taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the\n  conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction\n  pipeline (see fig. 1).Based on the described scenario, I have written an animation demo to show how instructions are executed in a pipeline in different situations.Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the\n  conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the\n  next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline.The example contains three instructions and the first one is a conditional jump instruction. The latter two instructions can go into the pipeline until the conditional jump instruction is executed.It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.It will take 7 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.The time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to\n  the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the\n  execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long\n  pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock\n  cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a\n  more advanced branch predictor.As you can see, it seems we don't have a reason not to use Branch Predictor.It's quite a simple demo that clarifies the very basic part of Branch Predictor. If those gifs are annoying, please feel free to remove them from the answer and visitors can also get the live demo source code from BranchPredictorDemo",
                "Branch-prediction gain!It is important to understand that branch misprediction doesn't slow down programs. The cost of a missed prediction is just as if branch prediction didn't exist and you waited for the evaluation of the expression to decide what code to run (further explanation in the next paragraph).Whenever there's an if-else \\ switch statement, the expression has to be evaluated to determine which block should be executed. In the assembly code generated by the compiler, conditional branch instructions are inserted.A branch instruction can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order (i.e. if the expression is false, the program skips the code of the if block) depending on some condition, which is the expression evaluation in our case.That being said, the compiler tries to predict the outcome prior to it being actually evaluated. It will fetch instructions from the if block, and if the expression turns out to be true, then wonderful! We gained the time it took to evaluate it and made progress in the code; if not then we are running the wrong code, the pipeline is flushed, and the correct block is run.Let's say you need to pick route 1 or route 2. Waiting for your partner to check the map, you have stopped at ## and waited, or you could just pick route1 and if you were lucky (route 1 is the correct route), then great you didn't have to wait for your partner to check the map (you saved the time it would have taken him to check the map), otherwise you will just turn back.While flushing pipelines is super fast, nowadays taking this gamble is worth it. Predicting sorted data or a data that changes slowly is always easier and better than predicting fast changes.",
                "On ARM, there is no branch needed, because every instruction has a 4-bit condition field, which tests (at zero cost) any of 16 different different conditions that may arise in the Processor Status Register, and if the condition on an instruction is false, the instruction is skipped. This eliminates the need for short branches, and there would be no branch prediction hit for this algorithm. Therefore, the sorted version of this algorithm would run slower than the unsorted version on ARM, because of the extra overhead of sorting.The inner loop for this algorithm would look something like the following in ARM assembly language:But this is actually part of a bigger picture:CMP opcodes always update the status bits in the Processor Status Register (PSR), because that is their purpose, but most other instructions do not touch the PSR unless you add an optional S suffix to the instruction, specifying that the PSR should be updated based on the result of the instruction. Just like the 4-bit condition suffix, being able to execute instructions without affecting the PSR is a mechanism that reduces the need for branches on ARM, and also facilitates out of order dispatch at the hardware level, because after performing some operation X that updates the status bits, subsequently (or in parallel) you can do a bunch of other work that explicitly should not affect (or be affected by) the status bits, then you can test the state of the status bits set earlier by X.The condition testing field and the optional \"set status bit\" field can be combined, for example:Most processor architectures do not have this ability to specify whether or not the status bits should be updated for a given operation, which can necessitate writing additional code to save and later restore status bits, or may require additional branches, or may limit the processor's out of order execution efficiency: one of the side effects of most CPU instruction set architectures forcibly updating status bits after most instructions is that it is much harder to tease apart which instructions can be run in parallel without interfering with each other. Updating status bits has side effects, therefore has a linearizing effect on code. ARM's ability to mix and match branch-free condition testing on any instruction with the option to either update or not update the status bits after any instruction is extremely powerful, for both assembly language programmers and compilers, and produces very efficient code.When you don't have to branch, you can avoid the time cost of flushing the pipeline for what would otherwise be short branches, and you can avoid the design complexity of many forms of speculative evalution. The performance impact of the initial naive imlementations of the mitigations for many recently discovered processor vulnerabilities (Spectre etc.) shows you just how much the performance of modern processors depends upon complex speculative evaluation logic. With a short pipeline and the dramatically reduced need for branching, ARM just doesn't need to rely on speculative evaluation as much as CISC processors. (Of course high-end ARM implementations do include speculative evaluation, but it's a smaller part of the performance story.)If you have ever wondered why ARM has been so phenomenally successful, the brilliant effectiveness and interplay of these two mechanisms (combined with another mechanism that lets you \"barrel shift\" left or right one of the two arguments of any arithmetic operator or offset memory access operator at zero additional cost) are a big part of the story, because they are some of the greatest sources of the ARM architecture's efficiency. The brilliance of the original designers of the ARM ISA back in 1983, Steve Furber and Roger (now Sophie) Wilson, cannot be overstated.",
                "It's about branch prediction. What is it?A branch predictor is one of the ancient performance-improving techniques which still finds relevance in modern architectures. While the simple prediction techniques provide fast lookup and power efficiency they suffer from a high misprediction rate.On the other hand, complex branch predictions \u2013either neural-based or variants of two-level branch prediction \u2013provide better prediction accuracy, but they consume more power and complexity increases exponentially.In addition to this, in complex prediction techniques, the time taken to predict the branches is itself very high \u2013ranging from 2 to 5 cycles \u2013which is comparable to the execution time of actual branches.Branch prediction is essentially an optimization (minimization) problem where the emphasis is on to achieve lowest possible miss rate, low power consumption, and low complexity with minimum resources.There really are three different kinds of branches:Forward conditional branches - based on a run-time condition, the PC (program counter) is changed to point to an address forward in the instruction stream.Backward conditional branches - the PC is changed to point backward in the instruction stream. The branch is based on some condition, such as branching backwards to the beginning of a program loop when a test at the end of the loop states the loop should be executed again.Unconditional branches - this includes jumps, procedure calls, and returns that have no specific condition. For example, an unconditional jump instruction might be coded in assembly language as simply \"jmp\", and the instruction stream must immediately be directed to the target location pointed to by the jump instruction, whereas a conditional jump that might be coded as \"jmpne\" would redirect the instruction stream only if the result of a comparison of two values in a previous \"compare\" instructions shows the values to not be equal. (The segmented addressing scheme used by the x86 architecture adds extra complexity since jumps can be either \"near\" (within a segment) or \"far\" (outside the segment). Each type has different effects on branch prediction algorithms.)Static/dynamic Branch Prediction: Static branch prediction is used by the microprocessor the first time a conditional branch is encountered, and dynamic branch prediction is used for succeeding executions of the conditional branch code.References:Branch predictorA Demonstration of Self-ProfilingBranch Prediction ReviewBranch Prediction (Using wayback machine)",
                "Besides the fact that the branch prediction may slow you down, a sorted array has another advantage:You can have a stop condition instead of just checking the value, this way you only loop over the relevant data, and ignore the rest.\nThe branch prediction will miss only once.",
                "Sorted arrays are processed faster than an unsorted array, due to a phenomena called branch prediction.The branch predictor is a digital circuit (in computer architecture) trying to predict which way a branch will go, improving the flow in the instruction pipeline. The circuit/computer predicts the next step and executes it.Making a wrong prediction leads to going back to the previous step, and executing with another prediction. Assuming the prediction is correct, the code will continue to the next step. A wrong prediction results in repeating the same step, until a correct prediction occurs.The answer to your question is very simple.In an unsorted array, the computer makes multiple predictions, leading to an increased chance of errors.\nWhereas, in a sorted array, the computer makes fewer predictions, reducing the chance of errors.\nMaking more predictions requires more time.Sorted Array: Straight RoadUnsorted Array: Curved RoadBranch prediction: Guessing/predicting which road is straight and following it without checkingAlthough both the roads reach the same destination, the straight road is shorter, and the other is longer. If then you choose the other by mistake, there is no turning back, and so you will waste some extra time if you choose the longer road. This is similar to what happens in the computer, and I hope this helped you understand better.Also I want to cite @Simon_Weaver from the comments:It doesn\u2019t make fewer predictions - it makes fewer incorrect predictions. It still has to predict for each time through the loop...",
                "I tried the same code with MATLAB 2011b with my MacBook Pro (Intel i7, 64 bit, 2.4 GHz) for the following MATLAB code:The results for the above MATLAB code are as follows:The results of the C code as in @GManNickG I get:Based on this, it looks MATLAB is almost 175 times slower than the C implementation without sorting and 350 times slower with sorting. In other words, the effect (of branch prediction) is 1.46x for MATLAB implementation and 2.7x for the C implementation.",
                "The assumption by other answers that one needs to sort the data is not correct.The following code does not sort the entire array, but only 200-element segments of it, and thereby runs the fastest.Sorting only k-element sections completes the pre-processing in linear time, O(n), rather than the O(n.log(n)) time needed to sort the entire array.This also \"proves\" that it has nothing to do with any algorithmic issue such as sort order, and it is indeed branch prediction.",
                "Bjarne Stroustrup's Answer to this question:That sounds like an interview question. Is it true? How would you know? It is a bad idea to answer questions about efficiency without first doing some measurements, so it is important to know how to measure.So, I tried with a vector of a million integers and got:I ran that a few times to be sure. Yes, the phenomenon is real. My key code was:At least the phenomenon is real with this compiler, standard library, and optimizer settings. Different implementations can and do give different answers. In fact, someone did do a more systematic study (a quick web search will find it) and most implementations show that effect.One reason is branch prediction: the key operation in the sort algorithm is \u201cif(v[i] < pivot]) \u2026\u201d or equivalent. For a sorted sequence that test is always true whereas, for a random sequence, the branch chosen varies randomly.Another reason is that when the vector is already sorted, we never need to move elements to their correct position. The effect of these little details is the factor of five or six that we saw.Quicksort (and sorting in general) is a complex study that has attracted some of the greatest minds of computer science. A good sort function is a result of both choosing a good algorithm and paying attention to hardware performance in its implementation.If you want to write efficient code, you need to know a bit about machine architecture.",
                "This question is rooted in branch prediction models on CPUs. I'd recommend reading this paper:Increasing the Instruction Fetch Rate via Multiple Branch Prediction and a Branch Address Cache  (But real CPUs these days still don't make multiple taken branch-predictions per clock cycle, except for Haswell and later effectively unrolling tiny loops in its loop buffer.  Modern CPUs can predict multiple branches not-taken to make use of their fetches in large contiguous blocks.)When you have sorted elements, branch prediction easily predicts correctly except right at the boundary, letting instructions flow through the CPU pipeline efficiently, without having to rewind and take the correct path on mispredictions.",
                "An answer for quick and simple understanding (read the others for more details)This concept is called branch predictionBranch prediction is an optimization technique that predicts the path the code will take before it is known with certainty. This is important because during the code execution, the machine prefetches several code statements and stores them in the pipeline.The problem arises in conditional branching, where there are two possible paths or parts of the code that can be executed.When the prediction was true, the optimization technique worked out.When the prediction was false, to explain it in a simple way, the code statement stored in the pipeline gets proved wrong and the actual code has to be completely reloaded, which takes up a lot of time.As common sense suggests, predictions of something sorted are way more accurate than predictions of something unsorted.branch prediction visualisation:sorted\n\nunsorted",
                "It is a branch prediction failure. You don't need to sort the array, but you just need to partition it with the value 128. Sorting is n*log(n), whereas partitioning is just linear. Basically it is just one run of the quick sort partitioning step with the pivot chosen to be 128. Unfortunately in C++ there is just nth_element function, which partition by position, not by value.The answer to this question is that it auto-vectorizes. As usual compilers don't pick perfect strategies. (Although GCC's might be optimal for SSE2 or SSE4.)"

I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.You want to destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes.  You do this:The result is:Now B is the HEAD.  Because you used --hard, your files are reset to their state at commit B.Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to undo the commit but keep your changes for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:Do this, leaving off the --hard:In this case, the result is:In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a git reset HEAD~1, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use --hard) you leave your files as they were.  So now git status shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven't lost a thing!For the lightest touch, you can even undo your commit but leave your files and your index:This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your index alone.  When you do git status, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do git commit and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.One more thing: Suppose you destroy a commit as in the first example, but then discover you needed it after all?  Tough luck, right?Nope, there's still a way to get it back.  Type thisand you'll see a list of (partial) commit shas (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in.

However, it wouldn't hurt if you did it anyway.You can verify that the remote-tracking branch origin/X was also deleted by running the following:If you didn't delete your remote branch X from the command line (like above), then your local repository will still contain (a now obsolete) remote-tracking branch origin/X.

                "In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.git fetch updates your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/. This operation is safe to run at any time since it never changes any of your local branches under refs/heads.git pull brings a local branch up-to-date with its remote version, while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.From the Git documentation for git pull:git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and then depending on configuration options or command line flags, will call either git rebase or git merge to reconcile diverging branches.It is helpful to keep in mind that when working on any Git respository on any particular machine, the repository contains a copy of all branches from all remotes as well as a copy of each local branch you have done some work on.You can see this using git branch -a, which should show your local branches, including master, and all branches from all remotes.Above, I have indicated the existance of a remote origin repo as well as another remote by another name another-remote-machine.Note you do not necessarily have to have a copy of each branch on all repositories. (Remotes and local.) It will depend on when you have synchronized things by running git pull, git push, git fetch, from the different machines/repositories involved.",
                "git pull tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. It is context sensitive, so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch.  git pull automatically merges the commits without letting you review them first. If you don\u2019t carefully manage your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.git fetch gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your current branch, you must use git merge afterwards.",
                "It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the \"server\" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.git fetch is the command that says \"bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date.\"git pull says \"bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code.\"Normally git pull does this by doing a git fetch to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least three copies of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local \"cached\" copy of a remote repository.",

This could, of course, result in merge conflicts. Let's say your remote is origin and your branch is master. If you git diff origin/master before pulling, you should have some idea of potential merge conflicts and could prepare your local branch accordingly.In addition to pulling and pushing, some workflows involve git rebase, such as this one, which I paraphrase from the linked article:If you find yourself in such a situation, you may be tempted to git pull --rebase. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, I would advise against that. This warning is from the man page for git-pull, version 2.3.5:This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation.

                "The Difference between GIT Fetch and GIT Pull can be explained with the following scenario:\n(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.So,\nInitial State of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (A, B and C are Modules already completed of the project)Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose D)  and when you have completed the D module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module E, F and modified C.\nSo now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module D to malfunction.To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:1. Git Fetch- This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.So now You can carefully monitor the files before merging it to your repository. And you can also modify D if required because of Modified C.2. Git Pull- This will update your local branch with the origin/main branch i.e. actually what it does is a combination of Git Fetch and Git merge one after another.\nBut this may Cause Conflicts to occur, so it\u2019s recommended to use Git Pull with a clean copy.",

                "In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection\u2026 before departing you could just do git fetch origin <branch>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace.On the plane, you could make changes to your local workspace and then merge it with what you've previously fetched and then resolve potential merge conflicts all without a connection to the Internet. And unless someone had made new changes to the remote repository then once you arrive at the destination you would do git push origin <branch> and go get your coffee.From this awesome Atlassian tutorial:The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a\nremote repository into your local repository.Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has\nbeen working on. It\u2019s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see\nhow the central history has progressed, but it doesn\u2019t force you to\nactually merge the changes into your repository. Git isolates\nfetched content as a from existing local content, it has absolutely\nno effect on your local development work. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the git checkout command. This makes\nfetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with\nyour local repository.When downloading content from a remote repository, git pull and git fetch commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider\ngit fetch the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download\nthe remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,\nleaving your current work intact. git pull is the more aggressive\nalternative, it will download the remote content for the active local\nbranch and immediately execute git merge to create a merge commit\nfor the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress\nthis will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution\nflow.With git pull:Hmmm...so if I'm not updating the working copy with git fetch, then where am I making changes? Where does Git fetch store the new commits?Great question. First and foremost, the heads or remotes don't store the new commits. They just have pointers to commits. So with git fetch you download the latest git objects (blob, tree, commits. To fully understand the objects watch this video on git internals), but only update your remotes pointer to point to the latest commit of that branch.  It's still isolated from your working copy, because your branch's pointer in the heads directory hasn't updated. It will only update upon a merge/pull. But again where? Let's find out.In your project directory (i.e., where you do your git commands) do:ls. This will show the files & directories. Nothing cool, I know.Now do ls -a. This will show dot files, i.e., files beginning with . You will then be able to see a directory named: .git.Do cd .git. This will obviously change your directory.Now comes the fun part; do ls. You will see a list of directories. We're looking for refs. Do cd refs.It's interesting to see what's inside all directories, but let's focus on two of them. heads and remotes. Use cd to check inside them too.Any git fetch that you do will update the pointer in the /.git/refs/remotes directory. It won't update anything in the /.git/refs/heads directory.Any git pull will first do the git fetch and update items in the /.git/refs/remotes directory.  It will then also merge with your local and then change the head inside the /.git/refs/heads directory.A very good related answer can also be found in Where does 'git fetch' place itself?.Also, look for \"Slash notation\" from the Git branch naming conventions post. It helps you better understand how Git places things in different directories.Just do:If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:If you didn't fetch and just did git checkout master then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a git fetch and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a potential merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing git pull from the remote branch.If you fetched a remote branch e.g. did:Then this would go into your remotes directory. It's still not available to your local directory. However, it simplifies your checkout to that remote branch by DWIM (Do what I mean):you no longer need to do:For more on that read here",

                "To understand what yield does, you must understand what generators are. And before you can understand generators, you must understand iterables.When you create a list, you can read its items one by one. Reading its items one by one is called iteration:mylist is an iterable. When you use a list comprehension, you create a list, and so an iterable:Everything you can use \"for... in...\" on is an iterable; lists, strings, files...These iterables are handy because you can read them as much as you wish, but you store all the values in memory and this is not always what you want when you have a lot of values.Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly:It is just the same except you used () instead of []. BUT, you cannot perform for i in mygenerator a second time since generators can only be used once: they calculate 0, then forget about it and calculate 1, and end calculating 4, one by one.yield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.Here it's a useless example, but it's handy when you know your function will return a huge set of values that you will only need to read once.To master yield, you must understand that when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky.Then, your code will continue from where it left off each time for uses the generator.Now the hard part:The first time the for calls the generator object created from your function, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits yield, then it'll return the first value of the loop. Then, each subsequent call will run another iteration of the loop you have written in the function and return the next value. This will continue until the generator is considered empty, which happens when the function runs without hitting yield. That can be because the loop has come to an end, or because you no longer satisfy an \"if/else\".Generator:Caller:This code contains several smart parts:The loop iterates on a list, but the list expands while the loop is being iterated. It's a concise way to go through all these nested data even if it's a bit dangerous since you can end up with an infinite loop. In this case, candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist)) exhausts all the values of the generator, but while keeps creating new generator objects which will produce different values from the previous ones since it's not applied on the same node.The extend() method is a list object method that expects an iterable and adds its values to the list.Usually, we pass a list to it:But in your code, it gets a generator, which is good because:And it works because Python does not care if the argument of a method is a list or not. Python expects iterables so it will work with strings, lists, tuples, and generators! This is called duck typing and is one of the reasons why Python is so cool. But this is another story, for another question...You can stop here, or read a little bit to see an advanced use of a generator:Note: For Python 3, useprint(corner_street_atm.__next__()) or print(next(corner_street_atm))It can be useful for various things like controlling access to a resource.The itertools module contains special functions to manipulate iterables. Ever wish to duplicate a generator?\nChain two generators? Group values in a nested list with a one-liner? Map / Zip without creating another list?Then just import itertools.An example? Let's see the possible orders of arrival for a four-horse race:Iteration is a process implying iterables (implementing the __iter__() method) and iterators (implementing the __next__() method).\nIterables are any objects you can get an iterator from. Iterators are objects that let you iterate on iterables.There is more about it in this article about how for loops work.",
                "When you see a function with yield statements, apply this easy trick to understand what will happen:This trick may give you an idea of the logic behind the function, but what actually happens with yield is significantly different than what happens in the list-based approach. In many cases, the yield approach will be a lot more memory efficient and faster too. In other cases, this trick will get you stuck in an infinite loop, even though the original function works just fine. Read on to learn more...First, the iterator protocol - when you writePython performs the following two steps:Gets an iterator for mylist:Call iter(mylist) -> this returns an object with a next() method (or __next__() in Python 3).[This is the step most people forget to tell you about]Uses the iterator to loop over items:Keep calling the next() method on the iterator returned from step 1. The return value from next() is assigned to x and the loop body is executed. If an exception StopIteration is raised from within next(), it means there are no more values in the iterator and the loop is exited.The truth is Python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loop over the contents of an object - so it could be a for loop, but it could also be code like otherlist.extend(mylist) (where otherlist is a Python list).Here mylist is an iterable because it implements the iterator protocol. In a user-defined class, you can implement the __iter__() method to make instances of your class iterable. This method should return an iterator. An iterator is an object with a next() method. It is possible to implement both __iter__() and next() on the same class, and have __iter__() return self. This will work for simple cases, but not when you want two iterators looping over the same object at the same time.So that's the iterator protocol, many objects implement this protocol:Note that a for loop doesn't know what kind of object it's dealing with - it just follows the iterator protocol, and is happy to get item after item as it calls next(). Built-in lists return their items one by one, dictionaries return the keys one by one, files return the lines one by one, etc. And generators return... well that's where yield comes in:Instead of yield statements, if you had three return statements in f123() only the first would get executed, and the function would exit. But f123() is no ordinary function. When f123() is called, it does not return any of the values in the yield statements! It returns a generator object. Also, the function does not really exit - it goes into a suspended state. When the for loop tries to loop over the generator object, the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from, executes the next line of code, in this case, a yield statement, and returns that as the next item. This happens until the function exits, at which point the generator raises StopIteration, and the loop exits.So the generator object is sort of like an adapter - at one end it exhibits the iterator protocol, by exposing __iter__() and next() methods to keep the for loop happy. At the other end, however, it runs the function just enough to get the next value out of it, and puts it back in suspended mode.Usually, you can write code that doesn't use generators but implements the same logic. One option is to use the temporary list 'trick' I mentioned before. That will not work in all cases, for e.g. if you have infinite loops, or it may make inefficient use of memory when you have a really long list. The other approach is to implement a new iterable class SomethingIter that keeps the state in instance members and performs the next logical step in its next() (or __next__() in Python 3) method. Depending on the logic, the code inside the next() method may end up looking very complex and prone to bugs. Here generators provide a clean and easy solution.",
                "Think of it this way:An iterator is just a fancy sounding term for an object that has a next() method.  So a yield-ed function ends up being something like this:Original version:This is basically what the Python interpreter does with the above code:For more insight as to what's happening behind the scenes, the for loop can be rewritten to this:Does that make more sense or just confuse you more?  :)I should note that this is an oversimplification for illustrative purposes. :)",
                "The yield keyword is reduced to two simple facts:In a nutshell: Most commonly, a generator is a lazy, incrementally-pending list, and yield statements allow you to use function notation to program the list values the generator should incrementally spit out. Furthermore, advanced usage lets you use generators as coroutines (see below).Basically, whenever the yield statement is encountered, the function pauses and saves its state, then emits \"the next return value in the 'list'\" according to the python iterator protocol (to some syntactic construct like a for-loop that repeatedly calls next() and catches a StopIteration exception, etc.). You might have encountered generators with generator expressions; generator functions are more powerful because you can pass arguments back into the paused generator function, using them to implement coroutines. More on that later.Let's define a function makeRange that's just like Python's range. Calling makeRange(n) RETURNS A GENERATOR:To force the generator to immediately return its pending values, you can pass it into list() (just like you could any iterable):The above example can be thought of as merely creating a list which you append to and return:There is one major difference, though; see the last section.An iterable is the last part of a list comprehension, and all generators are iterable, so they're often used like so:To get a better feel for generators, you can play around with the itertools module (be sure to use chain.from_iterable rather than chain when warranted). For example, you might even use generators to implement infinitely-long lazy lists like itertools.count(). You could implement your own def enumerate(iterable): zip(count(), iterable), or alternatively do so with the yield keyword in a while-loop.Please note: generators can actually be used for many more things, such as implementing coroutines or non-deterministic programming or other elegant things. However, the \"lazy lists\" viewpoint I present here is the most common use you will find.This is how the \"Python iteration protocol\" works. That is, what is going on when you do list(makeRange(5)). This is what I describe earlier as a \"lazy, incremental list\".The built-in function next() just calls the objects .__next__() function, which is a part of the \"iteration protocol\" and is found on all iterators. You can manually use the next() function (and other parts of the iteration protocol) to implement fancy things, usually at the expense of readability, so try to avoid doing that...Coroutine example:A coroutine (generators which generally accept input via the yield keyword e.g. nextInput = yield nextOutput, as a form of two-way communication) is basically a computation which is allowed to pause itself and request input (e.g. to what it should do next). When the coroutine pauses itself (when the running coroutine eventually hits a yield keyword), the computation is paused and control is inverted (yielded) back to the 'calling' function (the frame which requested the next value of the computation). The paused generator/coroutine remains paused until another invoking function (possibly a different function/context) requests the next value to unpause it (usually passing input data to direct the paused logic interior to the coroutine's code).You can think of python coroutines as lazy incrementally-pending lists, where the next element doesn't just depend on the previous computation, but also on input you may opt to inject during the generation process.Normally, most people would not care about the following distinctions and probably want to stop reading here.In Python-speak, an iterable is any object which \"understands the concept of a for-loop\" like a list [1,2,3], and an iterator is a specific instance of the requested for-loop like [1,2,3].__iter__(). A generator is exactly the same as any iterator, except for the way it was written (with function syntax).When you request an iterator from a list, it creates a new iterator. However, when you request an iterator from an iterator (which you would rarely do), it just gives you a copy of itself.Thus, in the unlikely event that you are failing to do something like this...... then remember that a generator is an iterator; that is, it is one-time-use. If you want to reuse it, you should call myRange(...) again. If you need to use the result twice, convert the result to a list and store it in a variable x = list(myRange(5)). Those who absolutely need to clone a generator (for example, who are doing terrifyingly hackish metaprogramming) can use itertools.tee (still works in Python 3) if absolutely necessary, since the copyable iterator Python PEP standards proposal has been deferred.",
                "What does the yield keyword do in Python?yield is only legal inside of a function definition, and the inclusion of yield in a function definition makes it return a generator.The idea for generators comes from other languages (see footnote 1) with varying implementations.

If you want more or have some constructive criticism, let me know by commenting\nbelow.The top/accepted answer is a very incomplete answer.The grammar currently allows any expression in a list comprehension.Since yield is an expression, it has been touted by some as interesting to use it in comprehensions or generator expression - in spite of citing no particularly good use-case.The CPython core developers are discussing deprecating its allowance.\nHere's a relevant post from the mailing list:On 30 January 2017 at 19:05, Brett Cannon  wrote:On Sun, 29 Jan 2017 at 16:39 Craig Rodrigues  wrote:I'm OK with either approach.

The returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct StopIteration and becomes the StopIteration.value attribute.Historical note, in Python 2:\n\"In a generator function, the return statement is not allowed to include an expression_list.

                "yield is just like return - it returns whatever you tell it to (as a generator). The difference is that the next time you call the generator, execution starts from the last call to the yield statement. Unlike return, the stack frame is not cleaned up when a yield occurs, however control is transferred back to the caller, so its state will resume the next time the function is called.In the case of your code, the function get_child_candidates is acting like an iterator so that when you extend your list, it adds one element at a time to the new list.list.extend calls an iterator until it's exhausted. In the case of the code sample you posted, it would be much clearer to just return a tuple and append that to the list.",

When a function has a yield in it we call it a generator function. And an iterator is what it returns. Those terms are revealing. We lose the convenience of a container, but gain the power of a series that's computed as needed, and arbitrarily long.Yield is lazy, it puts off computation. A function with a yield in it doesn't actually execute at all when you call it. It returns an iterator object that remembers where it left off. Each time you call next() on the iterator (this happens in a for-loop) execution inches forward to the next yield. return raises StopIteration and ends the series (this is the natural end of a for-loop).Yield is versatile. Data doesn't have to be stored all together, it can be made available one at a time. It can be infinite.If you need multiple passes and the series isn't too long, just call list() on it:Brilliant choice of the word yield because both meanings apply:yield \u2014 produce or provide (as in agriculture)...provide the next data in the series.yield \u2014 give way or relinquish (as in political power)...relinquish CPU execution until the iterator advances.",
                "Yield gives you a generator.As you can see, in the first case foo holds the entire list in memory at once. It's not a big deal for a list with 5 elements, but what if you want a list of 5 million? Not only is this a huge memory eater, it also costs a lot of time to build at the time that the function is called.In the second case, bar just gives you a generator. A generator is an iterable--which means you can use it in a for loop, etc, but each value can only be accessed once. All the values are also not stored in memory at the same time; the generator object \"remembers\" where it was in the looping the last time you called it--this way, if you're using an iterable to (say) count to 50 billion, you don't have to count to 50 billion all at once and store the 50 billion numbers to count through.Again, this is a pretty contrived example, you probably would use itertools if you really wanted to count to 50 billion. :)This is the most simple use case of generators. As you said, it can be used to write efficient permutations, using yield to push things up through the call stack instead of using some sort of stack variable. Generators can also be used for specialized tree traversal, and all manner of other things.",
                "It's returning a generator. I'm not particularly familiar with Python, but I believe it's the same kind of thing as C#'s iterator blocks if you're familiar with those.The key idea is that the compiler/interpreter/whatever does some trickery so that as far as the caller is concerned, they can keep calling next() and it will keep returning values - as if the generator method was paused. Now obviously you can't really \"pause\" a method, so the compiler builds a state machine for you to remember where you currently are and what the local variables etc look like. This is much easier than writing an iterator yourself.",
                "There is one type of answer that I don't feel has been given yet, among the many great answers that describe how to use generators. Here is the programming language theory answer:The yield statement in Python returns a generator. A generator in Python is a function that returns continuations (and specifically a type of coroutine, but continuations represent the more general mechanism to understand what is going on).Continuations in programming languages theory are a much more fundamental kind of computation, but they are not often used, because they are extremely hard to reason about and also very difficult to implement. But the idea of what a continuation is, is straightforward: it is the state of a computation that has not yet finished. In this state, the current values of variables, the operations that have yet to be performed, and so on, are saved. Then at some point later in the program the continuation can be invoked, such that the program's variables are reset to that state and the operations that were saved are carried out.Continuations, in this more general form, can be implemented in two ways. In the call/cc way, the program's stack is literally saved and then when the continuation is invoked, the stack is restored.In continuation passing style (CPS), continuations are just normal functions (only in languages where functions are first class) which the programmer explicitly manages and passes around to subroutines. In this style, program state is represented by closures (and the variables that happen to be encoded in them) rather than variables that reside somewhere on the stack. Functions that manage control flow accept continuation as arguments (in some variations of CPS, functions may accept multiple continuations) and manipulate control flow by invoking them by simply calling them and returning afterwards. A very simple example of continuation passing style is as follows:In this (very simplistic) example, the programmer saves the operation of actually writing the file into a continuation (which can potentially be a very complex operation with many details to write out), and then passes that continuation (i.e, as a first-class closure) to another operator which does some more processing, and then calls it if necessary. (I use this design pattern a lot in actual GUI programming, either because it saves me lines of code or, more importantly, to manage control flow after GUI events trigger.)The rest of this post will, without loss of generality, conceptualize continuations as CPS, because it is a hell of a lot easier to understand and read.Now let's talk about generators in Python. Generators are a specific subtype of continuation. Whereas continuations are able in general to save the state of a computation (i.e., the program's call stack), generators are only able to save the state of iteration over an iterator. Although, this definition is slightly misleading for certain use cases of generators. For instance:This is clearly a reasonable iterable whose behavior is well defined -- each time the generator iterates over it, it returns 4 (and does so forever). But it isn't probably the prototypical type of iterable that comes to mind when thinking of iterators (i.e., for x in collection: do_something(x)). This example illustrates the power of generators: if anything is an iterator, a generator can save the state of its iteration.To reiterate: Continuations can save the state of a program's stack and generators can save the state of iteration. This means that continuations are more a lot powerful than generators, but also that generators are a lot, lot easier. They are easier for the language designer to implement, and they are easier for the programmer to use (if you have some time to burn, try to read and understand this page about continuations and call/cc).But you could easily implement (and conceptualize) generators as a simple, specific case of continuation passing style:Whenever yield is called, it tells the function to return a continuation.  When the function is called again, it starts from wherever it left off. So, in pseudo-pseudocode (i.e., not pseudocode, but not code) the generator's next method is basically as follows:where the yield keyword is actually syntactic sugar for the real generator function, basically something like:Remember that this is just pseudocode and the actual implementation of generators in Python is more complex. But as an exercise to understand what is going on, try to use continuation passing style to implement generator objects without use of the yield keyword.",

I will provide a correspondence between high-level human concepts to low-level Python concepts.I want to operate on a sequence of numbers, but I don't want to bother my self with the creation of that sequence, I want only to focus on the operation I want to do. So, I do the following:This is what a generator does (a function that contains a yield); it starts executing on the first next(), pauses whenever it does a yield, and when asked for the next() value it continues from the point it was last.

So, whenever you do a:it doesn't matter if sequence is a list, a string, a dictionary or a generator object like described above; the result is the same: you read items off a sequence one by one.Note that defining a function which contains a yield keyword is not the only way to create a generator; it's just the easiest way to create one.For more accurate information, read about iterator types, the yield statement and generators in the Python documentation.",
                "While a lot of answers show why you'd use a yield to create a generator, there are more uses for yield.  It's quite easy to make a coroutine, which enables the passing of information between two blocks of code.  I won't repeat any of the fine examples that have already been given about using yield to create a generator.To help understand what a yield does in the following code, you can use your finger to trace the cycle through any code that has a yield.  Every time your finger hits the yield, you have to wait for a next or a send to be entered.  When a next is called, you trace through the code until you hit the yield\u2026 the code on the right of the yield is evaluated and returned to the caller\u2026 then you wait.  When next is called again, you perform another loop through the code.  However, you'll note that in a coroutine, yield can also be used with a send\u2026 which will send a value from the caller into the yielding function. If a send is given, then yield receives the value sent, and spits it out the left hand side\u2026 then the trace through the code progresses until you hit the yield again (returning the value at the end, as if next was called).For example:",
                "There is another yield use and meaning (since Python 3.3):From PEP 380 -- Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator:A syntax is proposed for a generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator. This allows a section of code containing 'yield' to be factored out and placed in another generator. Additionally, the subgenerator is allowed to return with a value, and the value is made available to the delegating generator.The new syntax also opens up some opportunities for optimisation when one generator re-yields values produced by another.Moreover this will introduce (since Python 3.5):to avoid coroutines being confused with a regular generator (today yield is used in both).",

So, it has a new name generator object as displayed in Out[11]: <generator object num_list at 0x10327c990>.In conclusion, as a metaphor to grok it:",
                "From a programming viewpoint, the iterators are implemented as thunks.To implement iterators, generators, and thread pools for concurrent execution, etc. as thunks, one uses messages sent to a closure object, which has a dispatcher, and the dispatcher answers to \"messages\".\"next\" is a message sent to a closure, created by the \"iter\" call.There are lots of ways to implement this computation. I used mutation, but it is possible to do this kind of computation without mutation, by returning the current value and the next yielder (making it referential transparent).  Racket uses a sequence of transformations of the initial program in some intermediary languages, one of such rewriting making the yield operator to be transformed in some language with simpler operators.Here is a demonstration of how yield could be rewritten, which uses the structure of R6RS, but the semantics is identical to Python's. It's the same model of computation, and only a change in syntax is required to rewrite it using yield of Python.",

                "I was going to post \"read page 19 of Beazley's 'Python: Essential Reference' for a quick description of generators\", but so many others have posted good descriptions already.Also, note that yield can be used in coroutines as the dual of their use in generator functions.  Although it isn't the same use as your code snippet, (yield) can be used as an expression in a function.  When a caller sends a value to the method using the send() method, then the coroutine will execute until the next (yield) statement is encountered.Generators and coroutines are a cool way to set up data-flow type applications.  I thought it would be worthwhile knowing about the other use of the yield statement in functions.",
                "Here is a simple example:Output:I am not a Python developer, but it looks to me yield holds the position of program flow and the next loop start from \"yield\" position. It seems like it is waiting at that position, and just before that, returning a value outside, and next time continues to work.It seems to be an interesting and nice ability :D",
                "Here is a mental image of what yield does.I like to think of a thread as having a stack (even when it's not implemented that way).When a normal function is called, it puts its local variables on the stack, does some computation, then clears the stack and returns. The values of its local variables are never seen again.With a yield function, when its code begins to run (i.e. after the function is called, returning a generator object, whose next() method is then invoked), it similarly puts its local variables onto the stack and computes for a while. But then, when it hits the yield statement, before clearing its part of the stack and returning, it takes a snapshot of its local variables and stores them in the generator object. It also writes down the place where it's currently up to in its code (i.e. the particular yield statement).So it's a kind of a frozen function that the generator is hanging onto.When next() is called subsequently, it retrieves the function's belongings onto the stack and re-animates it. The function continues to compute from where it left off, oblivious to the fact that it had just spent an eternity in cold storage.Compare the following examples:When we call the second function, it behaves very differently to the first. The yield statement might be unreachable, but if it's present anywhere, it changes the nature of what we're dealing with.Calling yielderFunction() doesn't run its code, but makes a generator out of the code. (Maybe it's a good idea to name such things with the yielder prefix for readability.)The gi_code and gi_frame fields are where the frozen state is stored. Exploring them with dir(..), we can confirm that our mental model above is credible.",
                "Imagine that you have created a remarkable machine that is capable of generating thousands and thousands of lightbulbs per day. The machine generates these lightbulbs in boxes with a unique serial number. You don't have enough space to store all of these lightbulbs at the same time, so you would like to adjust it to generate lightbulbs on-demand.Python generators don't differ much from this concept. Imagine that you have a function called barcode_generator that generates unique serial numbers for the boxes. Obviously, you can have a huge number of such barcodes returned by the function, subject to the hardware (RAM) limitations. A wiser, and space efficient, option is to generate those serial numbers on-demand.Machine's code:Note the next(barcode) bit.As you can see, we have a self-contained \u201cfunction\u201d to generate the next unique serial number each time. This function returns a generator! As you can see, we are not calling the function each time we need a new serial number, but instead we are using next() given the generator to obtain the next serial number.To be more precise, this generator is a lazy iterator! An iterator is an object that helps us traverse a sequence of objects. It's called lazy because it does not load all the items of the sequence in memory until they are needed. The use of next in the previous example is the explicit way to obtain the next item from the iterator. The implicit way is using for loops:This will print barcodes infinitely, yet you will not run out of memory.In other words, a generator looks like a function but behaves like an iterator.Finally, real-world applications? They are usually useful when you work with big sequences. Imagine reading a huge file from disk with billions of records. Reading the entire file in memory, before you can work with its content, will probably be infeasible (i.e., you will run out of memory).",
                "An easy example to understand what it is: yieldThe output is:",
                "Like every answer suggests, yield is used for creating a sequence generator. It's used for generating some sequence dynamically. For example, while reading a file line by line on a network, you can use the yield function as follows:You can use it in your code as follows:Execution Control Transfer gotchaThe execution control will be transferred from getNextLines() to the for loop when yield is executed. Thus, every time getNextLines() is invoked, execution begins from the point where it was paused last time.Thus in short, a function with the following codewill print",
                "(My below answer only speaks from the perspective of using Python generator, not the underlying implementation of generator mechanism, which involves some tricks of stack and heap manipulation.)When yield is used instead of a return in a python function, that function is turned into something special called generator function. That function will return an object of generator type. The yield keyword is a flag to notify the python compiler to treat such function specially. Normal functions will terminate once some value is returned from it. But with the help of the compiler, the generator function can be thought of as resumable. That is, the execution context will be restored and the execution will continue from last run. Until you explicitly call return, which will raise a StopIteration exception (which is also part of the iterator protocol), or reach the end of the function. I found a lot of references about generator but this one from the functional programming perspective is the most digestable.(Now I want to talk about the rationale behind generator, and the iterator based on my own understanding. I hope this can help you grasp the essential motivation of iterator and generator. Such concept shows up in other languages as well such as C#.)As I understand, when we want to process a bunch of data, we usually first store the data somewhere and then process it one by one. But this naive approach is problematic. If the data volume is huge, it's expensive to store them as a whole beforehand. So instead of storing the data itself directly, why not store some kind of metadata indirectly, i.e. the logic how the data is computed.There are 2 approaches to wrap such metadata.Either way, an iterator is created, i.e. some object that can give you the data you want. The OO approach may be a bit complex. Anyway, which one to use is up to you.",
                "In summary, the yield statement transforms your function into a factory that produces a special object called a generator which wraps around the body of your original function. When the generator is iterated, it executes your function  until it reaches the next yield then suspends execution and evaluates to the value passed to yield. It repeats this process on each iteration until the path of execution exits the function. For instance,simply outputsThe power comes from using the generator with a loop that calculates a sequence, the generator executes the loop stopping each time to 'yield' the next result of the calculation, in this way it calculates a list on the fly, the benefit being the memory saved for especially large calculationsSay you wanted to create a your own range function that produces an iterable range of numbers, you could do it like so,and use it like this;But this is inefficient becauseLuckily Guido and his team were generous enough to develop generators so we could just do this;Now upon each iteration a function on the generator called next() executes the function until it either reaches a 'yield' statement in which it stops and  'yields' the value or reaches the end of the function. In this case on the first call, next() executes up to the yield statement and yield 'n', on the next call it will execute the  increment statement, jump back to the 'while', evaluate it, and if true, it will stop and yield 'n' again, it will continue that way until the while condition returns false and the generator jumps to the end of the function.",
                "Yield is an objectA return in a function will return a single value.If you want a function to return a huge set of values, use yield.More importantly, yield is a barrier.like barrier in the CUDA language, it will not transfer control until it gets\n  completed.That is, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits yield. Then, it\u2019ll return the first value of the loop.Then, every other call will run the loop you have written in the function one more time, returning the next value until there isn't any value to return.",
                "Many people use return rather than yield, but in some cases yield can be more efficient and easier to work with.Here is an example which yield is definitely best for:return (in function)yield (in function)Calling functionsBoth functions do the same thing, but yield uses three lines instead of five and has one less variable to worry about.This is the result from the code:As you can see both functions do the same thing. The only difference is return_dates() gives a list and yield_dates() gives a generator.A real life example would be something like reading a file line by line or if you just want to make a generator.",
                "The yield keyword simply collects returning results. Think of yield like return +=",
                "yield is like a return element for a function. The difference is, that the yield element turns a function into a generator. A generator behaves just like a function until something is 'yielded'. The generator stops until it is next called, and continues from exactly the same point as it started.

We simply create a new array, from start to the index we want to remove, and concatenate another array from the first position following the one we removed to the end of the array.In this case, one good option is to use filter(), which offers a more declarative approach:const items = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\nconst valueToRemove = 'c'\nconst filteredItems = items.filter(item => item !== valueToRemove)\n\nconsole.log(filteredItems)This uses the ES6 arrow functions.

First, you must identify the index of the target item. You then use the index as the start element and remove just one element.| In-place: No | \n| Removes duplicates: Yes | \n| By value / index: By value |The specific element can be filtered out from the array, by providing a filtering function. Such function is then called for every element in the array.| In-place: Yes/No (Depends on implementation) | \n| Removes duplicates: Yes/No (Depends on implementation) | \n| By value / index: By index / By value (Depends on implementation) |The prototype of Array can be extended with additional methods.

Any element whose index is greater than or equal to the new length will be removed.| In-place: Yes | \n| Removes duplicates: No | \n| By value / index: N/A |The pop method removes the last element of the array, returns that element, and updates the length property. The pop method modifies the array on which it is invoked, This means unlike using delete the last element is removed completely and the array length reduced.| In-place: Yes | \n| Removes duplicates: No | \n| By value / index: N/A |The .shift() method works much like the pop method except it removes the first element of a JavaScript array instead of the last.

                "An addition to the accepted answer, if your mistakenly-added file was huge, you'll probably notice that, even after removing it from the index with 'git reset', it still seems to occupy space in the .git directory.This is nothing to be worried about; the file is indeed still in the repository, but only as a \"loose object\". It will not be copied to other repositories (via clone, push), and the space will be eventually reclaimed - though perhaps not very soon. If you are anxious, you can run:Update (what follows is my attempt to clear some confusion that can arise from the most upvoted answers):So, which is the real undo of git add?git reset HEAD <file> ?orgit rm --cached <file>?Strictly speaking, and if I'm not mistaken: none.git add cannot be undone - safely, in general.Let's recall first what git add <file> actually does:If <file> was not previously tracked, git add adds it to the cache, with its current content.If <file> was already tracked, git add saves the current content (snapshot, version) to the cache. In Git, this action is still called add, (not mere update it), because two different versions (snapshots) of a file are regarded as two different items: hence, we are indeed adding a new item to the cache, to be eventually committed later.In light of this, the question is slightly ambiguous:I mistakenly added files using the command...The OP's scenario seems to be the first one (untracked file),  we want the \"undo\" to remove the file (not just the current contents) from the tracked items. If this is the case, then it's ok to run  git rm --cached <file>.And we could also run git reset HEAD <file>. This is in general preferable, because it works in both scenarios: it also does the undo when we wrongly added a version of an already tracked item.But there are two caveats.First: There is (as pointed out in the answer) only one scenario in which git reset HEAD doesn't work, but git rm --cached does: a new repository (no commits). But, really, this a practically irrelevant case.Second: Be aware that git reset HEAD  can't magically recover the previously cached file contents, it just resynchronises it from the HEAD. If our misguided git add overwrote a previous staged uncommitted version, we can't recover it. That's why, strictly speaking, we cannot undo [*].Example:Of course, this is not very critical if we just follow the usual lazy workflow of doing 'git add' only for adding new files (case 1), and we update new contents via the commit, git commit -a command.* (Edit: the above is practically correct, but still there can be some slightly hackish/convoluted ways for recovering changes that were staged, but not committed and then overwritten - see the comments by Johannes Matokic and iolsmit)",

There is always a petition process to have standards revised. It is unlikely that annotations will be added to the JSON standard for several reasons.JSON by design is an easily reverse-engineered (human parsed) alternative to XML. It is simplified even to the point that annotations are unnecessary. It is not even a markup language. The goal is stability and  interoperablilty.Anyone who understands the \"has-a\" relationship of object orientation can understand any JSON structure - that is the whole point. It is just a  directed acyclic graph (DAG) with node tags (key/value pairs), which is a near universal data structure.This only annotation required might be \"//These are DAG tags\". The key names can be as informative as required, allowing arbitrary semantic arity.Any platform can parse JSON with just a few lines of code. XML requires complex OO libraries that are not viable on many platforms.Annotations would just make JSON less interoperable.

I read the file, convert it into the settings object with the Newtonsoft library and use it when necessary.I prefer writing comments about each individual setting in the JSON file itself, and I really don't care about the integrity of the JSON format as long as the library I use is OK with it.I think this is an 'easier to use/understand' way than creating a separate 'settings.README' file and explaining the settings in it.If you have a problem with this kind of usage; sorry, the genie is out of the lamp. People would find other usages for JSON format, and there is nothing you can do about it.",
                "If your text file, which is a JSON string, is going to be read by some program, how difficult would it be to strip out either C or C++ style comments before using it?Answer: It would be a one liner. If you do that then JSON files could be used as configuration files.",
                "The idea behind JSON is to provide simple data exchange between applications. These are typically web based and the language is JavaScript.It doesn't really allow for comments as such, however, passing a comment as one of the name/value pairs in the data would certainly work, although that data would obviously need to be ignored or handled specifically by the parsing code.All that said, it's not the intention that the JSON file should contain comments in the traditional sense. It should just be the data.Have a look at the JSON website for more detail.",
                "JSON does not support comments natively, but you can make your own decoder or at least preprocessor to strip out comments, that's perfectly fine (as long as you just ignore comments and don't use them to guide how your application should process the JSON data).JSON does not have comments. A JSON encoder MUST NOT output comments.\nA JSON decoder MAY accept and ignore comments.Comments should never be used to transmit anything meaningful. That is\nwhat JSON is for.Cf: Douglas Crockford, author of JSON spec.",
                "I just encountering this for configuration files. I don't want to use XML (verbose, graphically, ugly, hard to read), or \"ini\" format (no hierarchy, no real standard, etc.) or Java \"Properties\" format (like .ini).JSON can do all they can do, but it is way less verbose and more human readable - and parsers are easy and ubiquitous in many languages. It's just a tree of data. But out-of-band comments are a necessity often to document \"default\" configurations and the like. Configurations are never to be \"full documents\", but trees of saved data that can be human readable when needed.I guess one could use \"#\": \"comment\", for \"valid\" JSON.",

                "Yes, the new standard, JSON5 allows the C++ style comments, among many other extensions:The JSON5 Data Interchange Format (JSON5) is a superset of JSON that aims to alleviate some of the limitations of JSON. It is fully backwards compatible, and using it is probably better than writing the custom non standard parser, turning non standard features on for the existing one or using various hacks like string fields for commenting. Or, if the parser in use supports, simply agree we are using JSON 5 subset that is JSON and C++ style comments. It is much better than we tweak JSON standard the way we see fit.There is already npm package, Python package, Java package and C library available. It is backwards compatible. I see no reason to stay with the \"official\" JSON restrictions.I think that removing comments from JSON has been driven by the same reasons as removing the operator overloading in Java: can be used the wrong way yet some clearly legitimate use cases were overlooked. For operator overloading, it is matrix algebra and complex numbers. For JSON comments, its is configuration files and other documents that may be written, edited or read by humans and not just by parser.",
                "JSON makes a lot of sense for config files and other local usage because it's ubiquitous and because it's much simpler than XML.If people have strong reasons against having comments in JSON when communicating data (whether valid or not), then possibly JSON could be split into two:JSON-DOC will allow comments, and other minor differences might exist such as handling whitespace. Parsers can easily convert from one spec to the other.With regards to the remark made by Douglas Crockford on this issues (referenced by @Artur Czajka)Suppose you are using JSON to keep configuration files, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser.We're talking about a generic config file issue (cross language/platform), and he's answering with a JS specific utility!Sure a JSON specific minify can be implemented in any language,\nbut standardize this so it becomes ubiquitous across parsers in all languages and platforms so people stop wasting their time lacking the feature because they have good use-cases for it, looking the issue up in online forums, and getting people telling them it's a bad idea or suggesting it's easy to implement stripping comments out of text files.The other issue is interoperability. Suppose you have a library or API or any kind of subsystem which has some config or data files associated with it. And this subsystem is\nto be accessed from different languages.  Then do you go about telling people: by the way\ndon't forget to strip out the comments from the JSON files before passing them to the parser!",

                "The Dojo Toolkit JavaScript toolkit (at least as of version 1.4), allows you to include comments in your JSON. The comments can be of /* */ format.

                "Disclaimer: This is sillyThere is actually a way to add comments, and stay within the specification (no additional parser needed). It will not result into human-readable comments without any sort of parsing though.You could abuse the following:Insignificant whitespace is allowed before or after any token.\nWhitespace is any sequence of one or more of the following code\npoints: character tabulation (U+0009), line feed (U+000A), carriage\nreturn (U+000D), and space (U+0020).In a hacky way, you can abuse this to add a comment. For instance: start and end your comment with a tab. Encode the comment in base3 and use the other whitespace characters to represent them. For instance.(hello base three in ASCII) But instead of 0 use space, for 1 use line feed and for 2 use carriage return.This will just leave you with a lot of unreadable whitespace (unless you make an IDE plugin to encode/decode it on the fly).I never even tried this, for obvious reasons and neither should you.",

I've just spent an hour trying to make my program work with this example from Highcharts.If you follow the link, you will seeSince I had a similar file in my local folder, there were no issues with the Same-origin policy, so I decided to use pure JSON\u2026 and, of course, $.getJSON was failing silently because of the comments.Eventually I just sent a manual HTTP request to the address above and realized that the content-type was text/javascript since, well, JSONP returns pure JavaScript.

                "The stack is the memory set aside as scratch space for a thread of execution.  When a function is called, a block is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and some bookkeeping data.  When that function returns, the block becomes unused and can be used the next time a function is called.  The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order; the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.  This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack; freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation.  Unlike the stack, there's no enforced pattern to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the heap; you can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.  This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time; there are many custom heap allocators available to tune heap performance for different usage patterns.Each thread gets a stack, while there's typically only one heap for the application (although it isn't uncommon to have multiple heaps for different types of allocation).To answer your questions directly:To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created.  Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.What is their scope?The stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed.  The heap is typically allocated at application startup by the runtime, and is reclaimed when the application (technically process) exits.What determines the size of each of them?The size of the stack is set when a thread is created.  The size of the heap is set on application startup, but can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).What makes one faster?The stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it (a pointer/integer is simply incremented or decremented), while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation.  Also, each byte in the stack tends to be reused very frequently which means it tends to be mapped to the processor's cache, making it very fast. Another performance hit for the heap is that the heap, being mostly a global resource, typically has to be multi-threading safe, i.e. each allocation and deallocation needs to be - typically - synchronized with \"all\" other heap accesses in the program.A clear demonstration:\n\nImage source: vikashazrati.wordpress.com",

                "The most important point is that heap and stack are generic terms for ways in which memory can be allocated.  They can be implemented in many different ways, and the terms apply to the basic concepts.In a stack of items, items sit one on top of the other in the order they were placed there, and you can only remove the top one (without toppling the whole thing over).The simplicity of a stack is that you do not need to maintain a table containing a record of each section of allocated memory; the only state information you need is a single pointer to the end of the stack.  To allocate and de-allocate, you just increment and decrement that single pointer.  Note: a stack can sometimes be implemented to start at the top of a section of memory and extend downwards rather than growing upwards.In a heap, there is no particular order to the way items are placed.  You can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear 'top' item.Heap allocation requires maintaining a full record of what memory is allocated and what isn't, as well as some overhead maintenance to reduce fragmentation, find contiguous memory segments big enough to fit the requested size, and so on.  Memory can be deallocated at any time leaving free space.  Sometimes a memory allocator will perform maintenance tasks such as defragmenting memory by moving allocated memory around, or garbage collecting - identifying at runtime when memory is no longer in scope and deallocating it.These images should do a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a heap.  Yum!To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?As mentioned, heap and stack are general terms, and can be implemented in many ways.  Computer programs typically have a stack called a call stack which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called from, and any local variables.  Because functions call other functions and then return, the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call stack.  A program doesn't really have runtime control over it; it's determined by the programming language, OS and even the system architecture.A heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and randomly; i.e. out of order.  The memory is typically allocated by the OS, with the application calling API functions to do this allocation.  There is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated memory, which is usually handled by the runtime code of the programming language or environment used.What is their scope?The call stack is such a low level concept that it doesn't relate to 'scope' in the sense of programming.  If you disassemble some code you'll see relative pointer style references to portions of the stack, but as far as a higher level language is concerned, the language imposes its own rules of scope.  One important aspect of a stack, however, is that once a function returns, anything local to that function is immediately freed from the stack.  That works the way you'd expect it to work given how your programming languages work.  In a heap, it's also difficult to define.  The scope is whatever is exposed by the OS, but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a \"scope\" is in your application.  The processor architecture and the OS use virtual addressing, which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page faults, etc.  They keep track of what pages belong to which applications.  You never really need to worry about this, though, because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free memory, and check for errors (if the allocation/freeing fails for any reason).What determines the size of each of them?Again, it depends on the language, compiler, operating system and architecture.  A stack is usually pre-allocated, because by definition it must be contiguous memory.  The language compiler or the OS determine its size.  You don't store huge chunks of data on the stack, so it'll be big enough that it should never be fully used, except in cases of unwanted endless recursion (hence, \"stack overflow\") or other unusual programming decisions.A heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically allocated.  Depending on which way you look at it, it is constantly changing size.  In modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted anyway, so you don't normally need to worry much about how it works deep down, except that (in languages where it lets you) you mustn't use memory that you haven't allocated yet or memory that you have freed.What makes one faster?The stack is faster because all free memory is always contiguous.  No list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free memory, just a single pointer to the current top of the stack.  Compilers usually store this pointer in a special, fast register for this purpose.  What's more, subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of memory, which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor on-die caches.",
                "(I have moved this answer from another question that was more or less a dupe of this one.)The answer to your question is implementation specific and may vary across compilers and processor architectures. However, here is a simplified explanation.Can a function be allocated on the heap instead of a stack?No, activation records for functions (i.e. local or automatic variables) are allocated on the stack that is used not only to store these variables, but also to keep track of nested function calls.How the heap is managed is really up to the runtime environment. C uses malloc and C++ uses new, but many other languages have garbage collection.However, the stack is a more low-level feature closely tied to the processor architecture. Growing the heap when there is not enough space isn't too hard since it can be implemented in the library call that handles the heap. However, growing the stack is often impossible as the stack overflow only is discovered when it is too late; and shutting down the thread of execution is the only viable option.",
                "In the following C# codeHere's how the memory is managedLocal Variables that only need to last as long as the function invocation go in the stack. The heap is used for variables whose lifetime we don't really know up front but we expect them to last a while. In most languages it's critical that we know at compile time how large a variable is if we want to store it on the stack.Objects (which vary in size as we update them) go on the heap because we don't know at creation time how long they are going to last. In many languages the heap is garbage collected to find objects (such as the cls1 object) that no longer have any references.In Java, most objects go directly into the heap. In languages like C / C++, structs and classes can often remain on the stack when you're not dealing with pointers.More information can be found here:The difference between stack and heap memory allocation \u00ab  timmurphy.organd here:Creating Objects on the Stack and HeapThis article is the source of picture above: Six important .NET concepts: Stack, heap, value types, reference types, boxing, and unboxing - CodeProjectbut be aware it may contain some inaccuracies.",
                "The Stack\nWhen you call a function the arguments to that function plus some other overhead is put on the stack. Some info (such as where to go on return) is also stored there.\nWhen you declare a variable inside your function, that variable is also allocated on the stack.Deallocating the stack is pretty simple because you always deallocate in the reverse order in which you allocate. Stack stuff is added as you enter functions, the corresponding data is removed as you exit them. This means that you tend to stay within a small region of the stack unless you call lots of functions that call lots of other functions (or create a recursive solution).The Heap\nThe heap is a generic name for where you put the data that you create on the fly. If you don't know how many spaceships your program is going to create, you are likely to use the new (or malloc or equivalent) operator to create each spaceship. This allocation is going to stick around for a while, so it is likely we will free things in a different order than we created them.Thus, the heap is far more complex, because there end up being regions of memory that are unused interleaved with chunks that are - memory gets fragmented. Finding free memory of the size you need is a difficult problem. This is why the heap should be avoided (though it is still often used).Implementation\nImplementation of both the stack and heap is usually down to the runtime / OS. Often games and other applications that are performance critical create their own memory solutions that grab a large chunk of memory from the heap and then dish it out internally to avoid relying on the OS for memory.This is only practical if your memory usage is quite different from the norm - i.e for games where you load a level in one huge operation and can chuck the whole lot away in another huge operation.Physical location in memory\nThis is less relevant than you think because of a technology called Virtual Memory which makes your program think that you have access to a certain address where the physical data is somewhere else (even on the hard disc!). The addresses you get for the stack are in increasing order as your call tree gets deeper. The addresses for the heap are un-predictable (i.e implimentation specific) and frankly not important.",
                "Other answers just avoid explaining what static allocation means. So I will explain the three main forms of allocation and how they usually relate to the heap, stack, and data segment below. I also will show some examples in both C/C++ and Python to help people understand.\"Static\" (AKA statically allocated) variables are not allocated on the stack. Do not assume so - many people do only because \"static\" sounds a lot like \"stack\". They actually exist in neither the stack nor the heap. They are part of what's called the data segment.However, it is generally better to consider \"scope\" and \"lifetime\" rather than \"stack\" and \"heap\".Scope refers to what parts of the code can access a variable. Generally we think of local scope (can only be accessed by the current function) versus global scope (can be accessed anywhere) although scope can get much more complex.Lifetime refers to when a variable is allocated and deallocated during program execution. Usually we think of static allocation (variable will persist through the entire duration of the program, making it useful for storing the same information across several function calls) versus automatic allocation (variable only persists during a single call to a function, making it useful for storing information that is only used during your function and can be discarded once you are done) versus dynamic allocation (variables whose duration is defined at runtime, instead of compile time like static or automatic).Although most compilers and interpreters implement this behavior similarly in terms of using stacks, heaps, etc, a compiler may sometimes break these conventions if it wants as long as behavior is correct. For instance, due to optimization a local variable may only exist in a register or be removed entirely, even though most local variables exist in the stack. As has been pointed out in a few comments, you are free to implement a compiler that doesn't even use a stack or a heap, but instead some other storage mechanisms (rarely done, since stacks and heaps are great for this).I will provide some simple annotated C code to illustrate all of this. The best way to learn is to run a program under a debugger and watch the behavior. If you prefer to read python, skip to the end of the answer :)A particularly poignant example of why it's important to distinguish between lifetime and scope is that a variable can have local scope but static lifetime - for instance, \"someLocalStaticVariable\" in the code sample above. Such variables can make our common but informal naming habits very confusing. For instance when we say \"local\" we usually mean \"locally scoped automatically allocated variable\" and when we say global we usually mean \"globally scoped statically allocated variable\". Unfortunately when it comes to things like \"file scoped statically allocated variables\" many people just say... \"huh???\".Some of the syntax choices in C/C++ exacerbate this problem - for instance many people think global variables are not \"static\" because of the syntax shown below.Note that putting the keyword \"static\" in the declaration above prevents var2 from having global scope. Nevertheless, the global var1 has static allocation. This is not intuitive! For this reason, I try to never use the word \"static\" when describing scope, and instead say something like \"file\" or \"file limited\" scope. However many people use the phrase \"static\" or \"static scope\" to describe a variable that can only be accessed from one code file. In the context of lifetime, \"static\" always means the variable is allocated at program start and deallocated when program exits.Some people think of these concepts as C/C++ specific. They are not. For instance, the Python sample below illustrates all three types of allocation (there are some subtle differences possible in interpreted languages that I won't get into here).",
                "Others have answered the broad strokes pretty well, so I'll throw in a few details.Stack and heap need not be singular. A common situation in which you have more than one stack is if you have more than one thread in a process.  In this case each thread has its own stack. You can also have more than one heap, for example some DLL configurations can result in different DLLs allocating from different heaps, which is why it's generally a bad idea to release memory allocated by a different library.In C you can get the benefit of variable length allocation through the use of alloca, which allocates on the stack, as opposed to alloc, which allocates on the heap. This memory won't survive your return statement, but it's useful for a scratch buffer.Making a huge temporary buffer on Windows that you don't use much of is not free. This is because the compiler will generate a stack probe loop that is called every time your function is entered to make sure the stack exists (because Windows uses a single guard page at the end of your stack to detect when it needs to grow the stack. If you access memory more than one page off the end of the stack you will crash). Example:",
                "Others have directly answered your question, but when trying to understand the stack and the heap, I think it is helpful to consider the memory layout of a traditional UNIX process (without threads and mmap()-based allocators). The Memory Management Glossary web page has a diagram of this memory layout.The stack and heap are traditionally located at opposite ends of the process's virtual address space. The stack grows automatically when accessed, up to a size set by the kernel (which can be adjusted with setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, ...)). The heap grows when the memory allocator invokes the brk() or sbrk() system call, mapping more pages of physical memory into the process's virtual address space.In systems without virtual memory, such as some embedded systems, the same basic layout often applies, except the stack and heap are fixed in size. However, in other embedded systems (such as those based on Microchip PIC microcontrollers), the program stack is a separate block of memory that is not addressable by data movement instructions, and can only be modified or read indirectly through program flow instructions (call, return, etc.). Other architectures, such as Intel Itanium processors, have multiple stacks. In this sense, the stack is an element of the CPU architecture.",

When it comes to object variables, these are merely references (pointers) to the actual objects on the heap.\nEvery time an object is instantiated, a chunk of heap memory is set aside to hold the data (state) of that object. Since objects can contain other objects, some of this data can in fact hold references to those nested objects.",
                "The stack is a portion of memory that can be manipulated via several key assembly language instructions, such as 'pop' (remove and return a value from the stack) and 'push' (push a value to the stack), but also call (call a subroutine - this pushes the address to return to the stack) and return (return from a subroutine - this pops the address off of the stack and jumps to it).  It's the region of memory below the stack pointer register, which can be set as needed.  The stack is also used for passing arguments to subroutines, and also for preserving the values in registers before calling subroutines.The heap is a portion of memory that is given to an application by the operating system, typically through a syscall like malloc.  On modern OSes this memory is a set of pages that only the calling process has access to.The size of the stack is determined at runtime, and generally does not grow after the program launches.  In a C program, the stack needs to be large enough to hold every variable declared within each function.  The heap will grow dynamically as needed, but the OS is ultimately making the call (it will often grow the heap by more than the value requested by malloc, so that at least some future mallocs won't need to go back to the kernel to get more memory.  This behavior is often customizable)Because you've allocated the stack before launching the program, you never need to malloc before you can use the stack, so that's a slight advantage there.  In practice, it's very hard to predict what will be fast and what will be slow in modern operating systems that have virtual memory subsystems, because how the pages are implemented and where they are stored is an implementation detail.",

The reason for this distinction is that the original free store was implemented with a data structure known as a \"binomial heap.\"  For that reason, allocating from early implementations of malloc()/free() was allocation from a heap.  However, in this modern day, most free stores are implemented with very elaborate data structures that are not binomial heaps.",
                "You can do some interesting things with the stack.  For instance, you have functions like alloca (assuming you can get past the copious warnings concerning its use), which is a form of malloc that specifically uses the stack, not the heap, for memory.That said, stack-based memory errors are some of the worst I've experienced.  If you use heap memory, and you overstep the bounds of your allocated block, you have a decent chance of triggering a segment fault.  (Not 100%: your block may be incidentally contiguous with another that you have previously allocated.)  But since variables created on the stack are always contiguous with each other, writing out of bounds can change the value of another variable.  I have learned that whenever I feel that my program has stopped obeying the laws of logic, it is probably buffer overflow.",
                "Simply, the stack is where local variables get created. Also, every time you call a subroutine the program counter (pointer to the next machine instruction) and any important registers, and sometimes the parameters get pushed on the stack. Then any local variables inside the subroutine are pushed onto the stack (and used from there). When the subroutine finishes, that stuff all gets popped back off the stack. The PC and register data gets and put back where it was as it is popped, so your program can go on its merry way.The heap is the area of memory dynamic memory allocations are made out of (explicit \"new\" or \"allocate\" calls). It is a special data structure that can keep track of blocks of memory of varying sizes and their allocation status.In \"classic\" systems RAM was laid out such that the stack pointer started out at the bottom of memory, the heap pointer started out at the top, and they grew towards each other. If they overlap, you are out of RAM. That doesn't work with modern multi-threaded OSes though. Every thread has to have its own stack, and those can get created dynamicly.",
                "From WikiAnwser.When a function or a method calls another function which in turns calls another function, etc., the execution of all those functions remains suspended until the very last function returns its value.This chain of suspended function calls is the stack, because elements in the stack (function calls) depend on each other.The stack is important to consider in exception handling and thread executions.The heap is simply the memory used by programs to store variables.\nElement of the heap (variables) have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time.",
                "StackHeap",
                "A stack is used for static memory allocation and a heap for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computer's RAM.The StackThe stack is a \"LIFO\" (last in, first out) data structure, that is managed and optimized by the CPU quite closely. Every time a function declares a new variable, it is \"pushed\" onto the stack. Then every time a function exits, all of the variables pushed onto the stack by that function, are freed (that is to say, they are deleted). Once a stack variable is freed, that region of memory becomes available for other stack variables.The advantage of using the stack to store variables, is that memory is managed for you. You don't have to allocate memory by hand, or free it once you don't need it any more. What's more, because the CPU organizes stack memory so efficiently, reading from and writing to stack variables is very fast.More can be found here.The HeapThe heap is a region of your computer's memory that is not managed automatically for you, and is not as tightly managed by the CPU. It is a more free-floating region of memory (and is larger). To allocate memory on the heap, you must use malloc() or calloc(), which are built-in C functions. Once you have allocated memory on the heap, you are responsible for using free() to deallocate that memory once you don't need it any more.If you fail to do this, your program will have what is known as a memory leak. That is, memory on the heap will still be set aside (and won't be available to other processes). As we will see in the debugging section, there is a tool called Valgrind that can help you detect memory leaks.Unlike the stack, the heap does not have size restrictions on variable size (apart from the obvious physical limitations of your computer). Heap memory is slightly slower to be read from and written to, because one has to use pointers to access memory on the heap. We will talk about pointers shortly.Unlike the stack, variables created on the heap are accessible by any function, anywhere in your program. Heap variables are essentially global in scope.More can be found here.Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast, and its allocation is dealt with when the program is compiled. When a function or a method calls another function which in turns calls another function, etc., the execution of all those functions remains suspended until the very last function returns its value. The stack is always reserved in a LIFO order, the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed. This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack, freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower, but the heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory. Elements of the heap have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time. You can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time. This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time.You can use the stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time, and it is not too big. You can use the heap if you don't know exactly how much data you will need at runtime or if you need to allocate a lot of data.In a multi-threaded situation each thread will have its own completely independent stack, but they will share the heap. The stack is thread specific and the heap is application specific. The stack is important to consider in exception handling and thread executions.Each thread gets a stack, while there's typically only one heap for the application (although it isn't uncommon to have multiple heaps for different types of allocation).At run-time, if the application needs more heap, it can allocate memory from free memory and if the stack needs memory, it can allocate memory from free memory allocated memory for the application.Even, more detail is given here and here.Now come to your question's answers.To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created. Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.More can be found here.What is their scope?Already given in top.\"You can use the stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time, and it is not too big. You can use the heap if you don't know exactly how much data you will need at runtime or if you need to allocate a lot of data.\"More can be found in here.What determines the size of each of them?The size of the stack is set by OS when a thread is created. The size of the heap is set on application startup, but it can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).What makes one faster?Stack allocation is much faster since all it really does is move the stack pointer. Using memory pools, you can get comparable performance out of heap allocation, but that comes with a slight added complexity and its own headaches.Also, stack vs. heap is not only a performance consideration; it also tells you a lot about the expected lifetime of objects.Details can be found from here.",

                "Since some answers went nitpicking, I'm going to contribute my mite.Surprisingly, no one has mentioned that multiple (i.e. not related to the number of running OS-level threads) call stacks are to be found not only in exotic languages (PostScript) or platforms (Intel Itanium), but also in fibers, green threads and some implementations of coroutines.Fibers, green threads and coroutines are in many ways similar, which leads to much confusion.  The difference between fibers and green threads is that the former use cooperative multitasking, while the latter may feature either cooperative or preemptive one (or even both). For the distinction between fibers and coroutines, see here.In any case, the purpose of both fibers, green threads and coroutines is having multiple functions executing concurrently, but not in parallel (see this SO question for the distinction) within a single OS-level thread, transferring control back and forth from one another in an organized fashion.When using fibers, green threads or coroutines, you usually have a separate stack per function. (Technically, not just a stack but a whole context of execution is per function. Most importantly, CPU registers.) For every thread there're as many stacks as there're concurrently running functions, and the thread is switching between executing each function according to the logic of your program. When a function runs to its end, its stack is destroyed. So, the number and lifetimes of stacks are dynamic and are not determined by the number of OS-level threads!Note that I said \"usually have a separate stack per function\". There're both stackful and stackless implementations of couroutines. Most notable stackful C++ implementations are Boost.Coroutine and Microsoft PPL's async/await. (However, C++'s resumable functions (a.k.a. \"async and await\"), which were proposed to C++17, are likely to use stackless coroutines.)Fibers proposal to the C++ standard library is forthcoming. Also, there're some third-party libraries. Green threads are extremely popular in languages like Python and Ruby.",

                "Wow! So many answers and I don't think one of them got it right...1) Where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?The stack is memory that begins as the highest memory address allocated to your program image, and it then decrease in value from there. It is reserved for called function parameters and for all temporary variables used in functions.There are two heaps: public and private.The private heap begins on a 16-byte boundary (for 64-bit programs) or a 8-byte boundary (for 32-bit programs) after the last byte of code in your program, and then increases in value from there. It is also called the default heap.If the private heap gets too large it will overlap the stack area, as will the stack overlap the heap if it gets too big. Because the stack starts at a higher address and works its way down to lower address, with proper hacking you can get make the stack so large that it will overrun the private heap area and overlap the code area. The trick then is to overlap enough of the code area that you can hook into the code. It's a little tricky to do and you risk a program crash, but it's easy and very effective.The public heap resides in it's own memory space outside of your program image space. It is this memory that will be siphoned off onto the hard disk if memory resources get scarce.2) To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?The stack is controlled by the programmer, the private heap is managed by the OS, and the public heap is not controlled by anyone because it is an OS service -- you make requests and either they are granted or denied.2b) What is their scope?They are all global to the program, but their contents can be private, public, or global.2c) What determines the size of each of them?The size of the stack and the private heap are determined by your compiler runtime options. The public heap is initialized at runtime using a size parameter.2d) What makes one faster?They are not designed to be fast, they are designed to be useful. How the programmer utilizes them determines whether they are \"fast\" or \"slow\"REF:https://norasandler.com/2019/02/18/Write-a-Compiler-10.htmlhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-getprocessheaphttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapcreate",

                "Where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?ANSWER: Both are in RAM.ASIDE:RAM is like a desk and HDDs/SSDs (permanent storage) are like bookshelves. To read anything, you must have a book open on your desk, and you can only have as many books open as fit on your desk. To get a book, you pull it from your bookshelf and open it on your desk. To return a book, you close the book on your desk and return it to its bookshelf.Stack and heap are names we give to two ways compilers store different kinds of data in the same place (i.e. in RAM).What is their scope?\nWhat determines the size of each of them?\nWhat makes one faster?ANSWER:The stack is for static (fixed size) dataa. At compile time, the compiler reads the variable types used in your code.i. It allocates a fixed amount of memory for these variables.\nii. This size of this memory cannot grow.b. The memory is contiguous (a single block), so access is sometimes faster than the heapc. An object placed on the stack that grows in memory during runtime beyond the size of the stack causes a stack overflow errorThe heap is for dynamic (changing size) dataa. The amount of memory is limited only by the amount of empty space available in RAM\ni. The amount used can grow or shrink as needed at runtimeb. Since items are allocated on the heap by finding empty space wherever it exists in RAM, data is not always in a contiguous section, which sometimes makes access slower than the stackc. Programmers manually put items on the heap with the new keyword and MUST manually deallocate this memory when they are finished using it.\ni. Code that repeatedly allocates new memory without deallocating it when it is no longer needed leads to a memory leak.ASIDE:The stack and heap were not primarily introduced to improve speed; they were introduced to handle memory overflow. The first concern regarding use of the stack vs. the heap should be whether memory overflow will occur. If an object is intended to grow in size to an unknown amount (like a linked list or an object whose members can hold an arbitrary amount of data), place it on the heap. As far as possible, use the C++ standard library (STL) containers vector, map, and list as they are memory and speed efficient and added to make your life easier (you don't need to worry about memory allocation/deallocation).After getting your code to run, if you find it is running unacceptably slow, then go back and refactor your code and see if it can be programmed more efficiently. It may turn out the problem has nothing to do with the stack or heap directly at all (e.g. use an iterative algorithm instead of a recursive one, look at I/O vs. CPU-bound tasks, perhaps add multithreading or multiprocessing).I say sometimes slower/faster above because the speed of the program might not have anything to do with items being allocated on the stack or heap.To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?ANSWER:The stack size is determined at compile time by the compiler.The heap size varies during runtime. (The heap works with the OS during runtime to allocate memory.)ASIDE:Below is a little more about control and compile-time vs. runtime operations.Each computer has a unique instruction set architecture (ISA), which are its hardware commands (e.g. \"MOVE\", \"JUMP\", \"ADD\", etc.).An OS is nothing more than a resource manager (controls how/when/ and where to use memory, processors, devices, and information).The ISA of the OS is called the bare machine and the remaining commands are called the extended machine. The kernel is the first layer of the extended machine. It controls things likeWhen we say \"compiler\", we generally mean the compiler, assembler, and linker togetherThe machine code gets passed to the kernel when executed, which determines when it should run and take control, but the machine code itself contains ISA commands for requesting files, requesting memory, etc. So the code issues ISA commands, but everything has to pass by the kernel.",

                "CPU stack and heap are physically related to how CPU and registers works with memory, how machine-assembly language works, not high-level languages themselves, even if these languages can decide little things.All modern CPUs work with the \"same\" microprocessor theory: they are all based on what's called \"registers\" and some are for \"stack\" to gain performance. All CPUs have stack registers since the beginning and they had been always here, way of talking, as I know. Assembly languages are the same since the beginning, despite variations... up to Microsoft and its Intermediate Language (IL) that changed the paradigm to have a OO virtual machine assembly language. So we'll be able to have some CLI/CIL CPU in the future (one project of MS).CPUs have stack registers to speed up memories access, but they are limited compared to the use of others registers to get full access to all the available memory for the processus. It why we talked about stack and heap allocations.In summary, and in general, the heap is hudge and slow and is for \"global\" instances and objects content, as the stack is little and fast and for \"local\" variables and references (hidden pointers to forget to manage them).So when we use the new keyword in a method, the reference (an int) is created in the stack, but the object and all its content (value-types as well as objects) is created in the heap, if I remember. But local elementary value-types and arrays are created in the stack.The difference in memory access is at the cells referencing level: addressing the heap, the overall memory of the process, requires more complexity in terms of handling CPU registers, than the stack which is \"more\" locally in terms of addressing because the CPU stack register is used as base address, if I remember.It is why when we have very long or infinite recurse calls or loops, we got stack overflow quickly, without freezing the system on modern computers...C# Heap(ing) Vs Stack(ing) In .NETStack vs Heap: Know the DifferenceStatic class memory allocation where it is stored C#What and where are the stack and heap?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_managementhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_registerAssembly language resources:Assembly Programming TutorialIntel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals",

Only eight hex digits fit into a 32-bit integer, which is why only the last 8 characters are considered. After parsing the hex digits into 32-bit integers, they are then truncated into 8-bit integers by dividing them by 16 until they fit into 8-bit, which is why leading zeros are ignored.This code does not exactly match what is defined in the spec, but the only difference there is a few lines of code.

Or you can use it only for a specific function (still quoting from John Resig's article):Which might be helpful if you have to mix old and new code ;-)So, I suppose it's a bit like the \"use strict\" you can use in Perl (hence the name?): it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages.Strict mode is now supported by all major browsers.",
                "It's a new feature of ECMAScript 5. John Resig wrote up a nice summary of it.It's just a string you put in your JavaScript files (either at the top of your file or inside of a function) that looks like this:Putting it in your code now shouldn't cause any problems with current browsers as it's just a string. It may cause problems with your code in the future if your code violates the pragma.  For instance, if you currently have foo = \"bar\" without defining foo first, your code will start failing...which is a good thing in my opinion.",

                "A word of caution, all you hard-charging programmers:  applying \"use strict\" to existing code can be hazardous!  This thing is not some feel-good, happy-face sticker that you can slap on the code to make it 'better'.  With the \"use strict\" pragma, the browser will suddenly THROW exceptions in random places that it never threw before just because at that spot you are doing something that default/loose JavaScript happily allows but strict JavaScript abhors!  You may have strictness violations hiding in seldom used calls in your code that will only throw an exception when they do eventually get run - say, in the production environment that your paying customers use!If you are going to take the plunge, it is a good idea to apply \"use strict\" alongside comprehensive unit tests and a strictly configured JSHint build task that will give you some confidence that there is no dark corner of your module that will blow up horribly just because you've turned on Strict Mode.  Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add \"use strict\" to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly.  DEFINITELY DO NOT add \"use strict\" to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules.I think even though it is a deadly caged animal, \"use strict\" can be good stuff, but you have to do it right.  The best time to go strict is when your project is greenfield and you are starting from scratch. Configure JSHint/JSLint with all the warnings and options cranked up as tight as your team can stomach, get a good build/test/assert system du jour rigged like Grunt+Karma+Chai, and only THEN start marking all your new modules as \"use strict\".  Be prepared to cure lots of niggly errors and warnings.  Make sure everyone understands the gravity by configuring the build to FAIL if JSHint/JSLint produces any violations.My project was not a greenfield project when I adopted \"use strict\".  As a result, my IDE is full of red marks because I don't have \"use strict\" on half my modules, and JSHint complains about that.  It's a reminder to me about what refactoring I should do in the future.  My goal is to be red mark free due to all of my missing \"use strict\" statements, but that is years away now.",
                "The JavaScript strict mode is a feature in ECMAScript 5. You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.When a JavaScript engine sees this directive, it will start to interpret the code in a special mode. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode).Consider this example:In their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable b with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value 24 (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.For a non-exhaustive list of specialties in strict mode, see this answer.In my new JavaScript application: Absolutely! Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.In my existing JavaScript code: Probably not! If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. If you want strict mode, you should be prepared to debug and correct your existing code. This is why using 'use strict'; does not suddenly make your code better.Insert a 'use strict'; statement on top of your script:Note that everything in the file myscript.js will be interpreted in strict mode.Or, insert a 'use strict'; statement on top of your function body:Everything in the lexical scope of function doSomething will be interpreted in strict mode. The word lexical scope is important here. For example, if your strict code calls a function of a library that is not strict, only your code is executed in strict mode, and not the called function. See this answer for a better explanation.I found a nice article describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions\nare scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some\nfeatures make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is\nconfusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.\nMisunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.\nStatic scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile\ntime, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be\ndeferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance\npenalty.Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.\nThat means that the features that previously required dynamic binding\nmust be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is\neliminated, and the eval function\u2019s ability to tamper with the\nenvironment of its caller is severely restricted.One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like YUI Compressor\ncan do a better job when processing it.JavaScript has implied global variables. If\nyou do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is\nimplicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for\nbeginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping\nchores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more\ndifficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict\nmode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should\nexplicitly declare all of your variables.There are a number of situations that could cause this\nto be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to\nprovide the new prefix when calling a constructor function, the\nconstructor's this will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so\ninstead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently\ntampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will\ninstead bind this to undefined, which will cause the constructor to\nthrow an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much\nsooner.JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you\ncould not create them yourself until ES5\u2019s Object.createProperty\nfunction exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value\nto a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would\nnot change the property\u2019s value, but your program would proceed as\nthough it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to\ngo into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a\nread-only property will throw an exception.The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely\nuseful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word\nsizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC\n6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read\noctal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented\nthe op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the\nslow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was\nthought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was\nselected: Leading zero. So in C, 0100 means 64, not 100, and 08 is an\nerror, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been\ncopied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where\nit is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in\nstrict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more\narray-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its callee and caller\nproperties. This makes it possible to pass your arguments to untrusted\ncode without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the\narguments property of functions is eliminated.In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a\nsyntax error. A function can\u2019t have two parameters with the same name.\nA function can\u2019t have a variable with the same name as one of its\nparameters. A function can\u2019t delete its own variables. An attempt to\ndelete a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive\nvalues are not implicitly wrapped.ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:implements, interface, let, package, private, protected, public, static, and yield",
                "I strongly recommend every developer to start using strict mode now. There are enough browsers supporting it that strict mode will legitimately help save us from errors we didn\u2019t even know were in your code.Apparently, at the initial stage there will be errors we have never encountered before. To get the full benefit, we need to do proper testing after switching to strict mode to make sure we have caught everything. Definitely we don\u2019t just throw use strict in our code and assume there are no errors. So the churn is that it\u2019s time to start using this incredibly useful language feature to write better code.For example,JSLint is a debugger written by Douglas Crockford. Simply paste in your script, and it\u2019ll quickly scan for any noticeable issues and errors in your code.",
                "I would like to offer a somewhat more founded answer complementing the other answers. I was hoping to edit the most popular answer, but failed. I tried to make it as comprehensive and complete as I could.You can refer to the MDN documentation for more information.\"use strict\" a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.Directives are similar to statements, yet different.The use strict directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.\nThe code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a use strict directive.\nThe content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a use strict directive.\nCode that is passed to an eval() method is considered strict code when eval() was called from a strict code or contains the use strict directive itself.The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):Also when a function is invoked with call() or apply in strict mode, then this is exactly the value of the first argument of the call()or apply() invocation. (In normal mode null and undefined are replaced by the global Object and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)In strict mode you will get a TypeError, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)In strict mode, when passing code to eval(), you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for eval() and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after eval() finishes execution.In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat \"magical\" behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.In strict mode you will get a SyntaxError when the delete operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the delete expression would do nothing and is evaluated to false.In strict mode you will get a TypeError when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the delete expression is evaluated to false).In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with 0. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)In strict mode the identifiers eval and arguments are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. arguments.caller and arguments.callee cause a TypeError in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a TypeError when you try to read them.",
                "My two cents:One of the goals of strict mode is to allow for faster debugging of issues. It helps the developers by throwing exception when certain wrong things occur that can cause silent & strange behaviour of your webpage.

As a result many poor design decisions, un-intuitive syntax and confusing semantics found their way into the language.

So, \"use strict\" directive creates that alternative interpretation of the code while communicating it to the programmer.For example, this keywords refers to the object in a method definition, like this or self in other languages.this has no purpose outside the method context but all JavaScript functions have this keyword whether they are methods or not:Here this resolves to the global object which does not make sense and serves no purpose because global object is already available in the scope.In strict mode this in a global function resolves to undefined, which is what we expect.Some mistakes can not be fixed even in strict mode because syntax should be valid for older browsers since they ignore \"strict mode\" directive.

Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.\nThat means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.Now let's write the same function in strict mode.We will get the following error.Here, the compiler throws the reference error. In strict mode, the compiler does not allow us to use the variable without declaring it. So memory leaks can be prevented. In addition, we can write more optimized code.",

On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]Additional tip: To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple .js file. You can enforce this rule globally in eslint rules as follows:Filename: .eslintrc.jsOkay, so what is prevented in strict mode?Using a variable without declaring it will throw an error in strict mode. This is to prevent unintentionally creating global variables throughout your application.

If you check out to the remote branch directly after cloning your repository, you may see the \"detached HEAD\" status and the following message from Git:So how can we create a local branch to track a remote branch?To create a local branch to track a remote branch, you can use git checkout <remote branch name> or git switch <remote branch name>.

                "It's boilerplate code that protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to. Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard), then the latter script will trigger the former to run at import time and using the second script's command line arguments. This is almost always a mistake.If you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:it sets a few special variables like __name__, and thenit executes all of the code found in the file.Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called foo.py.When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the __name__ variable.When Your Module Is the Main ProgramIf you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string \"__main__\" to the __name__ variable, i.e.When Your Module Is Imported By AnotherOn the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:The interpreter will search for your foo.py file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name \"foo\" from the import statement to the __name__ variable, i.e.After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.AlwaysIt prints the string \"before import\" (without quotes).It loads the math module and assigns it to a variable called math. This is equivalent to replacing import math with the following (note that __import__ is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):It prints the string \"before function_a\".It executes the def block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called function_a.It prints the string \"before function_b\".It executes the second def block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called function_b.It prints the string \"before __name__ guard\".Only When Your Module Is the Main ProgramOnly When Your Module Is Imported by AnotherAlwaysSummaryIn summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a .py file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing .py files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. \"Running\" the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.Question: Can I have multiple __name__ checking blocks?  Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.Suppose the following is in foo2.py.  What happens if you say python foo2.py on the command-line? Why?",
                "When your script is run by passing it as a command to the Python interpreter,all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed.  Functions and classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets run.  Unlike other languages, there's no main() function that gets run automatically - the main() function is implicitly all the code at the top level.In this case, the top-level code is an if block.  __name__ is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.  However, if a module is being run directly (as in myscript.py above), then __name__ instead is set to the string \"__main__\".  Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly or being imported by something else by testingIf your script is being imported into another module, its various function and class definitions will be imported and its top-level code will be executed, but the code in the then-body of the if clause above won't get run as the condition is not met. As a basic example, consider the following two scripts:Now, if you invoke the interpreter asThe output will beIf you run two.py instead:You getThus, when module one gets loaded, its __name__ equals \"one\" instead of \"__main__\".",
                "Create the following two files:Now run each file individually.Running python a.py:When a.py is executed, it imports the module b. This causes all the code inside b to run. Python sets globals()['__name__'] in the b module to the module's name, b.Running python b.py:When only the file b.py is executed, Python sets globals()['__name__'] in this file to \"__main__\". Therefore, the if statement evaluates to True this time.",
                "To outline the basics:The global variable, __name__, in the module that is the entry point to your program, is '__main__'. Otherwise, it's the name you import the module by.So, code under the if block will only run if the module is the entry point to your program.It allows the code in the module to be importable by other modules, without executing the code block beneath on import.Why do we need this?Say you're writing a Python script designed to be used as a module:You could test the module by adding this call of the function to the bottom:and running it (on a command prompt) with something like:However, if you want to import the module to another script:On import, the do_important function would be called, so you'd probably comment out your function call, do_important(), at the bottom.And then you'll have to remember whether or not you've commented out your test function call. And this extra complexity would mean you're likely to forget, making your development process more troublesome.The __name__ variable points to the namespace wherever the Python interpreter happens to be at the moment.Inside an imported module, it's the name of that module.But inside the primary module (or an interactive Python session, i.e. the interpreter's Read, Eval, Print Loop, or REPL) you are running everything from its \"__main__\".So if you check before executing:With the above, your code will only execute when you're running it as the primary module (or intentionally call it from another script).There's a Pythonic way to improve on this, though.What if we want to run this business process from outside the module?If we put the code we want to exercise as we develop and test in a function like this and then do our check for '__main__' immediately after:We now have a final function for the end of our module that will run if we run the module as the primary module.It will allow the module and its functions and classes to be imported into other scripts without running the main function, and will also allow the module (and its functions and classes) to be called when running from a different '__main__' module, i.e.This idiom can also be found in the Python documentation in an explanation of the __main__ module. That text states:This module represents the (otherwise anonymous) scope in which the\n  interpreter\u2019s main program executes \u2014 commands read either from\n  standard input, from a script file, or from an interactive prompt. It\n  is this environment in which the idiomatic \u201cconditional script\u201d stanza\n  causes a script to run:",

                "__name__ is a global variable (in Python, global actually means on the module level) that exists in all namespaces. It is typically the module's name (as a str type).As the only special case, however, in whatever Python process you run, as in mycode.py:the otherwise anonymous global namespace is assigned the value of '__main__' to its __name__.Thus, including the final lineswill cause your script's uniquely defined main function to run.Another benefit of using this construct: you can also import your code as a module in another script and then run the main function if and when your program decides:",
                "There are lots of different takes here on the mechanics of the code in question, the \"How\", but for me none of it made sense until I understood the \"Why\". This should be especially helpful for new programmers.Take file \"ab.py\":And a second file \"xy.py\":What is this code actually doing?When you execute xy.py, you import ab. The import statement runs the module immediately on import, so ab's operations get executed before the remainder of xy's. Once finished with ab, it continues with xy.The interpreter keeps track of which scripts are running with __name__. When you run a script - no matter what you've named it - the interpreter calls it \"__main__\", making it the master or 'home' script that gets returned to after running an external script.Any other script that's called from this \"__main__\" script is assigned its filename as its __name__ (e.g., __name__ == \"ab.py\"). Hence, the line if __name__ == \"__main__\": is the interpreter's test to determine if it's interpreting/parsing the 'home' script that was initially executed, or if it's temporarily peeking into another (external) script. This gives the programmer flexibility to have the script behave differently if it's executed directly vs. called externally.Let's step through the above code to understand what's happening, focusing first on the unindented lines and the order they appear in the scripts. Remember that function - or def - blocks don't do anything by themselves until they're called. What the interpreter might say if mumbled to itself:The bottom two lines mean: \"If this is the \"__main__\" or 'home' script, execute the function called main()\". That's why you'll see a def main(): block up top, which contains the main flow of the script's functionality.Why implement this?Remember what I said earlier about import statements? When you import a module it doesn't just 'recognize' it and wait for further instructions - it actually runs all the executable operations contained within the script. So, putting the meat of your script into the main() function effectively quarantines it, putting it in isolation so that it won't immediately run when imported by another script.Again, there will be exceptions, but common practice is that main() doesn't usually get called externally. So you may be wondering one more thing: if we're not calling main(), why are we calling the script at all? It's because many people structure their scripts with standalone functions that are built to be run independent of the rest of the code in the file. They're then later called somewhere else in the body of the script. Which brings me to this:But the code works without itYes, that's right. These separate functions can be called from an in-line script that's not contained inside a main() function. If you're accustomed (as I am, in my early learning stages of programming) to building in-line scripts that do exactly what you need, and you'll try to figure it out again if you ever need that operation again ... well, you're not used to this kind of internal structure to your code, because it's more complicated to build and it's not as intuitive to read.But that's a script that probably can't have its functions called externally, because if it did it would immediately start calculating and assigning variables. And chances are if you're trying to re-use a function, your new script is related closely enough to the old one that there will be conflicting variables.In splitting out independent functions, you gain the ability to re-use your previous work by calling them into another script. For example, \"example.py\" might import \"xy.py\" and call x(), making use of the 'x' function from \"xy.py\". (Maybe it's capitalizing the third word of a given text string; creating a NumPy array from a list of numbers and squaring them; or detrending a 3D surface. The possibilities are limitless.)(As an aside, this question contains an answer by @kindall that finally helped me to understand - the why, not the how. Unfortunately it's been marked as a duplicate of this one, which I think is a mistake.)",

If I want to use them I can just import your script and use them without executing your program (given that your code only executes within the  if __name__ == \"__main__\": context). Whereas in C/C++ you would have to portion out those pieces into a separate module that then includes the file. Picture the situation below;The arrows are import links. For three modules each trying to include the previous modules code there are six files (nine, counting the implementation files) and five links. This makes it difficult to include other code into a C project unless it is compiled specifically as a library.

Likewise, when you execute a Python module from the command line, rather than importing it into another module, its __name__ attribute is assigned a value of __main__, rather than the actual name of the module.

The path of the actual module or package path is not given, but has its own DunderAlias __file__, that allows for this.You should see that, where __name__, where it is the main file (or program) will always return __main__, and if it is a module/package, or anything that is running off some other Python script, will return the name of the file where it has originated from.Being a variable means that it's value can be overwritten (\"can\" does not mean \"should\"), overwriting the value of __name__ will result in a lack of readability.  So do not do it, for any reason.  If you need a variable define a new variable.It is always assumed that the value of __name__ to be __main__ or the name of the file.  Once again changing this default value will cause more confusion that it will do good, causing problems further down the line.It is considered good practice in general to include the if __name__ == '__main__' in scripts.Now we know the behaviour of __name__ things become clearer:An if is a flow control statement that contains the block of code will execute if the value given is true. We have seen that __name__ can take either\n__main__ or the file name it has been imported from.This means that if __name__ is equal to __main__ then the file must be the main file and must actually be running (or it is the interpreter), not a module or package imported into the script.If indeed __name__ does take the value of __main__ then whatever is in that block of code will execute.This tells us that if the file running is the main file (or you are running from the interpreter directly) then that condition must execute.  If it is a package then it should not, and the value will not be __main__.__name__ can also be used in modules to define the name of a moduleIt is also possible to do other, less common but useful things with __name__, some I will show here:You can also use it to provide runnable help functions/utilities on packages and modules without the elaborate use of libraries.It also allows modules to be run from the command line as main scripts, which can be also very useful.",
                "I think it's best to break the answer in depth and in simple words:__name__: Every module in Python has a special attribute called __name__.\nIt is a built-in variable that returns the name of the module.__main__: Like other programming languages, Python too has an execution entry point, i.e., main. '__main__' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. Basically you have two ways of using a Python module: Run it directly as a script, or import it. When a module is run as a script, its __name__ is set to __main__.Thus, the value of the __name__ attribute is set to __main__ when the module is run as the main program. Otherwise the value of __name__  is set to contain the name of the module.",
                "It is a special for when a Python file is called from the command line. This is typically used to call a \"main()\" function or execute other appropriate startup code, like commandline arguments handling for instance.It could be written in several ways. Another is:I am not saying you should use this in production code, but it serves to illustrate that there is nothing \"magical\" about if __name__ == '__main__'.It just a convention for invoking a main function in Python files.",
                "There are a number of variables that the system (Python interpreter) provides for source files (modules).  You can get their values anytime you want, so, let us focus on the __name__ variable/attribute:When Python loads a source code file, it executes all of the code found in it. (Note that it doesn't call all of the methods and functions defined in the file, but it does define them.)Before the interpreter executes the source code file though, it defines a few special variables for that file; __name__ is one of those special variables that Python automatically defines for each source code file.If Python is loading this source code file as the main program (i.e. the file you run), then it sets the special __name__ variable for this file to have a value \"__main__\".If this is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to that module's name.So, in your example in part:means that the code block:will be executed only when you run the module directly; the code block will not execute if another module is calling/importing it because the value of __name__ will not equal to \"main\" in that particular instance.Hope this helps out.",
                "if __name__ == \"__main__\": is basically the top-level script environment, and it specifies the interpreter that ('I have the highest priority to be executed first').'__main__' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A module\u2019s __name__ is set equal to '__main__' when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.",
                "Consider:The output for the above is __main__.The above statement is true and prints \"direct method\". Suppose if they imported this class in another class it doesn't print \"direct method\" because, while importing, it will set __name__ equal to \"first model name\".",
                "In simple words:The code you see under if __name__ == \"__main__\": will only get called upon when your Python file is executed as python example1.pyHowever, if you wish to import your Python file example1.py as a module to work with another Python file, say example2.py, the code under if __name__ == \"__main__\": will not run or take any effect.",
                "You can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module.fibo.py (a module named fibo)Reference: https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html",
                "The reason foris primarily to avoid the import lock problems that would arise from having code directly imported. You want main() to run if your file was directly invoked (that's the __name__ == \"__main__\" case), but if your code was imported then the importer has to enter your code from the true main module to avoid import lock problems.A side-effect is that you automatically sign on to a methodology that supports multiple entry points. You can run your program using main() as the entry point, but you don't have to. While setup.py expects main(), other tools use alternate entry points. For example, to run your file as a gunicorn process, you define an app() function instead of a main(). Just as with setup.py, gunicorn imports your code so you don't want it do do anything while it's being imported (because of the import lock issue).",
                "If you are a beginner, probably the only answer you need right now is that this code is unnecessary for a simple script. It is only useful if you want to be able to import your script (or unpickle etc; see the other answers here for some other non-beginner scenarios).In slightly different words, the if __name__ guard is a mechanism for hiding code from other code. If you don't have a specific reason to hide something, don't: If you don't need to hide some code from import, don't put it behind this guard, and if you do, hide as little as possible.In slightly more detail, let's say you have a simple script fib.py (adapted from this answer):Now, if you simply run python fib.py it works fine. But __name__ will always be \"__main__\" in this scenario, so the condition is actually unnecessary. The script could be simplified to justNow, you can't import fib with the new version, but if you didn't plan to do that in the first place, this version is actually better, because it's simpler and clearer.If you do want to be able to import fib, the first version is useless, too, because the useful code is in a section which will not run when you import this file (in which case __name__ will not be \"__main__\"). The proper design in that case would be to refactor the code so that the useful parts are in a function you can run when you want to after you have imported it.Now, if you import fib, the call to main() will not be executed; but when you run python fib.py, it will.Actually, a better design still would be to isolate the reusable part (the actual calculation) from the user-visible input/output:Now, you can from fib import fibn and call the fibn() function from the code which performs this import.(I called the function fibn() just to make it clearer what is what in this example. In real life, you might call it fib() and do from fib import fib.)Similarly, you could import and call the main function if you wanted to reuse it.Returning to the code in the question, I would similarly move the code from the if into a function as well, so that callers can invoke that function if they want to.This changes the scope of the lock variable; if the surrounding code needs access to it, you will need to make it global (or, perhaps, better, refactor main to return lock, and have the caller capture the value in a local variable of its own).(Unlike in languages like C, the name main has no specific meaning to Python; but it's a common convention to use it as the name of the thing which will be run. You still have to actually explicitly call it, like main(), unlike in C.)",
                "Every module in Python has an attribute called __name__. The value of __name__  attribute is  __main__ when the module is run directly, like python my_module.py. Otherwise (like when you say import my_module) the value of __name__  is the name of the module.Small example to explain in short.We can execute this directly asOutputNow suppose we call the above script from another script:When you execute this,OutputSo, the above is self-explanatory that when you call test from another script, if loop __name__ in test.py will not execute.",
                "This answer is for Java programmers learning Python.\nEvery Java file typically contains one public class. You can use that class in two ways:Call the class from other files. You just have to import it in the calling program.Run the class stand alone, for testing purposes.For the latter case, the class should contain a public static void main() method. In Python this purpose is served by the globally defined label '__main__'.",

                "All the answers have pretty much explained the functionality. But I will provide one example of its usage which might help clearing out the concept further.Assume that you have two Python files, a.py and b.py. Now, a.py imports b.py. We run the a.py file, where the import b.py code is executed first. Before the rest of the a.py code runs, the code in the file b.py must run completely.In the b.py code, there is some code that is exclusive to that file b.py and we don't want any other file (other than the b.py file), that has imported the b.py file, to run it.So that is what this line of code checks. If it is the main file (i.e., b.py) running the code, which in this case it is not (a.py is the main file running), then only the code gets executed."

For example, stackoverflow.com/index.html.query --  A query string follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can utilize for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed).hash -- The anchor portion of a URL, includes the hash sign (#).With these Location object properties you can access all of these URL componentsNow If you want to change a page or redirect the user to some other page you can use the href property of the Location object like thisYou can use the href property of the Location object.Location Object also have these three methodsYou can use assign() and replace methods also to redirect to other pages like theseHow assign() and replace() differs -- The difference between replace() method and assign() method(), is that replace() removes the URL of the current document from the document history, means it is not possible to use the \"back\" button to navigate back to the original document. So Use the assign() method if you want to load a new document, andwant to give the option to navigate back to the original document.You can change the location object href property using jQuery also  like thisAnd hence you can redirect the user to some other url.",

If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use window.location.href or window.location.assign. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay.

You\u2019ll see your last five commits at the top like this:Instead of pick you need to write reword. You can do this in Vim by typing in i. That makes you go in to insert mode. (You see that you\u2019re in insert mode by the word INSERT at the bottom.) For the commits you want to change, type in reword instead of pick.Then you need to save and quit this screen. You do that by first going in to \u2018command-mode\u2019 by pressing the Escbutton (you can check that you\u2019re in command-mode if the word INSERT at the bottom has disappeared). Then you can type in a command by typing :. The command to save and quit is wq. So if you type in :wq you\u2019re on the right track.Then Vim will go over every commit message you want to reword, and here you can actually change the commit messages.

                "A closure is a pairing of:A lexical environment is part of every execution context (stack frame) and is a map between identifiers (i.e. local variable names) and values.Every function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer lexical environment. This reference is used to configure the execution context created when a function is invoked. This reference enables code inside the function to \"see\" variables declared outside the function, regardless of when and where the function is called.If a function was called by a function, which in turn was called by another function, then a chain of references to outer lexical environments is created. This chain is called the scope chain.In the following code, inner forms a closure with the lexical environment of the execution context created when foo is invoked, closing over variable secret:function foo() {\n  const secret = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100)\n  return function inner() {\n    console.log(`The secret number is ${secret}.`)\n  }\n}\nconst f = foo() // `secret` is not directly accessible from outside `foo`\nf() // The only way to retrieve `secret`, is to invoke `f`In other words: in JavaScript, functions carry a reference to a private \"box of state\", to which only they (and any other functions declared within the same lexical environment) have access. This box of the state is invisible to the caller of the function, delivering an excellent mechanism for data-hiding and encapsulation.And remember: functions in JavaScript can be passed around like variables (first-class functions), meaning these pairings of functionality and state can be passed around your program: similar to how you might pass an instance of a class around in C++.If JavaScript did not have closures, then more states would have to be passed between functions explicitly, making parameter lists longer and code noisier.So, if you want a function to always have access to a private piece of state, you can use a closure....and frequently we do want to associate the state with a function. For example, in Java or C++, when you add a private instance variable and a method to a class, you are associating the state with functionality.In C and most other common languages, after a function returns, all the local variables are no longer accessible because the stack-frame is destroyed. In JavaScript, if you declare a function within another function, then the local variables of the outer function can remain accessible after returning from it. In this way, in the code above, secret remains available to the function object inner, after it has been returned from foo.Closures are useful whenever you need a private state associated with a function. This is a very common scenario - and remember: JavaScript did not have a class syntax until 2015, and it still does not have a private field syntax. Closures meet this need.In the following code, the function toString closes over the details of the car.function Car(manufacturer, model, year, color) {\n  return {\n    toString() {\n      return `${manufacturer} ${model} (${year}, ${color})`\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst car = new Car('Aston Martin', 'V8 Vantage', '2012', 'Quantum Silver')\nconsole.log(car.toString())In the following code, the function inner closes over both fn and args.function curry(fn) {\n  const args = []\n  return function inner(arg) {\n    if(args.length === fn.length) return fn(...args)\n    args.push(arg)\n    return inner\n  }\n}\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b\n}\n\nconst curriedAdd = curry(add)\nconsole.log(curriedAdd(2)(3)()) // 5In the following code, function onClick closes over variable BACKGROUND_COLOR.const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)\nconst BACKGROUND_COLOR = 'rgba(200, 200, 242, 1)'\n\nfunction onClick() {\n  $('body').style.background = BACKGROUND_COLOR\n}\n\n$('button').addEventListener('click', onClick)\n<button>Set background color</button>In the following example, all the implementation details are hidden inside an immediately executed function expression. The functions tick and toString close over the private state and functions they need to complete their work. Closures have enabled us to modularize and encapsulate our code.let namespace = {};\n\n(function foo(n) {\n  let numbers = []\n\n  function format(n) {\n    return Math.trunc(n)\n  }\n\n  function tick() {\n    numbers.push(Math.random() * 100)\n  }\n\n  function toString() {\n    return numbers.map(format)\n  }\n\n  n.counter = {\n    tick,\n    toString\n  }\n}(namespace))\n\nconst counter = namespace.counter\ncounter.tick()\ncounter.tick()\nconsole.log(counter.toString())This example shows that the local variables are not copied in the closure: the closure maintains a reference to the original variables themselves. It is as though the stack-frame stays alive in memory even after the outer function exits.function foo() {\n  let x = 42\n  let inner = () => console.log(x)\n  x = x + 1\n  return inner\n}\n\nfoo()() // logs 43In the following code, three methods log, increment, and update all close over the same lexical environment.And every time createObject is called, a new execution context (stack frame) is created and a completely new variable x, and a new set of functions (log etc.) are created, that close over this new variable.function createObject() {\n  let x = 42;\n  return {\n    log() { console.log(x) },\n    increment() { x++ },\n    update(value) { x = value }\n  }\n}\n\nconst o = createObject()\no.increment()\no.log() // 43\no.update(5)\no.log() // 5\nconst p = createObject()\np.log() // 42If you are using variables declared using var, be careful you understand which variable you are closing over. Variables declared using var are hoisted. This is much less of a problem in modern JavaScript due to the introduction of let and const.In the following code, each time around the loop, a new function inner is created, which closes over i. But because var i is hoisted outside the loop, all of these inner functions close over the same variable, meaning that the final value of i (3) is printed, three times.function foo() {\n  var result = []\n  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    result.push(function inner() { console.log(i) } )\n  }\n\n  return result\n}\n\nconst result = foo()\n// The following will print `3`, three times...\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  result[i]() \n}",
                "Every function in JavaScript maintains a link to its outer lexical environment. A lexical environment is a map of all the names (eg. variables, parameters) within a scope, with their values.So, whenever you see the function keyword, code inside that function has access to variables declared outside the function.function foo(x) {\r\n  var tmp = 3;\r\n\r\n  function bar(y) {\r\n    console.log(x + y + (++tmp)); // will log 16\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  bar(10);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo(2);This will log 16 because function bar closes over the parameter x and the variable tmp, both of which exist in the lexical environment of outer function foo.Function bar, together with its link with the lexical environment of function foo is a closure.A function doesn't have to return in order to create a closure. Simply by virtue of its declaration, every function closes over its enclosing lexical environment, forming a closure.function foo(x) {\r\n  var tmp = 3;\r\n\r\n  return function (y) {\r\n    console.log(x + y + (++tmp)); // will also log 16\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar bar = foo(2);\r\nbar(10); // 16\r\nbar(10); // 17The above function will also log 16, because the code inside bar can still refer to argument x and variable tmp, even though they are no longer directly in scope.However, since tmp is still hanging around inside bar's closure, it is available to be incremented. It will be incremented each time you call bar.The simplest example of a closure is this:var a = 10;\r\n\r\nfunction test() {\r\n  console.log(a); // will output 10\r\n  console.log(b); // will output 6\r\n}\r\nvar b = 6;\r\ntest();When a JavaScript function is invoked, a new execution context ec is created. Together with the function arguments and the target object, this execution context also receives a link to the lexical environment of the calling execution context, meaning the variables declared in the outer lexical environment (in the above example, both a and b) are available from ec.Every function creates a closure because every function has a link to its outer lexical environment.Note that variables themselves are visible from within a closure, not copies.",
                "FOREWORD: this answer was written when the question was:Like the old Albert said : \"If you can't explain it to a six-year old, you really don't understand it yourself.\u201d. Well I tried to explain JS closures to a 27 years old friend and completely failed.Can anybody consider that I am 6 and strangely interested in that subject ?I'm pretty sure I was one of the only people that attempted to take the initial question literally. Since then, the question has mutated several times, so my answer may now seem incredibly silly & out of place. Hopefully the general idea of the story remains fun for some.I'm a big fan of analogy and metaphor when explaining difficult concepts, so let me try my hand with a story.Once upon a time:There was a princess...She lived in a wonderful world full of adventures. She met her Prince Charming, rode around her world on a unicorn, battled dragons, encountered talking animals, and many other fantastical things.But she would always have to return back to her dull world of chores and grown-ups.And she would often tell them of her latest amazing adventure as a princess.But all they would see is a little girl......telling stories about magic and fantasy.And even though the grown-ups knew of real princesses, they would never believe in the unicorns or dragons because they could never see them. The grown-ups said that they only existed inside the little girl's imagination.But we know the real truth; that the little girl with the princess inside......is really a princess with a little girl inside.",
                "Taking the question seriously, we should find out what a typical 6-year-old is capable of cognitively, though admittedly, one who is interested in JavaScript is not so typical.On  Childhood Development: 5 to 7 Years  it says:Your child will be able to follow two-step directions. For example, if you say to your child, \"Go to the kitchen and get me a trash bag\" they will be able to remember that direction.We can use this example to explain closures, as follows:The kitchen is a closure that has a local variable, called trashBags.  There is a function inside the kitchen called getTrashBag that gets one trash bag and returns it.We can code this in JavaScript like this:function makeKitchen() {\r\n  var trashBags = ['A', 'B', 'C']; // only 3 at first\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    getTrashBag: function() {\r\n      return trashBags.pop();\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar kitchen = makeKitchen();\r\n\r\nconsole.log(kitchen.getTrashBag()); // returns trash bag C\r\nconsole.log(kitchen.getTrashBag()); // returns trash bag B\r\nconsole.log(kitchen.getTrashBag()); // returns trash bag AFurther points that explain why closures are interesting:",
                "I need to know how many times a button has been clicked and do something on every third click...// Declare counter outside event handler's scope\nvar counter = 0;\nvar element = document.getElementById('button');\n\nelement.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  // Increment outside counter\n  counter++;\n\n  if (counter === 3) {\n    // Do something every third time\n    console.log(\"Third time's the charm!\");\n\n    // Reset counter\n    counter = 0;\n  }\n});\n<button id=\"button\">Click Me!</button>Now this will work, but it does encroach into the outer scope by adding a variable, whose sole purpose is to keep track of the count. In some situations, this would be preferable as your outer application might need access to this information. But in this case, we are only changing every third click's behavior, so it is preferable to enclose this functionality inside the event handler.var element = document.getElementById('button');\n\nelement.addEventListener(\"click\", (function() {\n  // init the count to 0\n  var count = 0;\n\n  return function(e) { // <- This function becomes the click handler\n    count++; //    and will retain access to the above `count`\n\n    if (count === 3) {\n      // Do something every third time\n      console.log(\"Third time's the charm!\");\n\n      //Reset counter\n      count = 0;\n    }\n  };\n})());\n<button id=\"button\">Click Me!</button>Notice a few things here.In the above example, I am using the closure behavior of JavaScript. This behavior allows any function to have access to the scope in which it was created, indefinitely. To practically apply this, I immediately invoke a function that returns another function, and because the function I'm returning has access to the internal count variable (because of the closure behavior explained above) this results in a private scope for usage by the resulting function... Not so simple? Let's dilute it down...A simple one-line closureAll variables outside the returned function are available to the returned function, but they are not directly available to the returned function object...Get it? So in our primary example, the count variable is contained within the closure and always available to the event handler, so it retains its state from click to click.Also, this private variable state is fully accessible, for both readings and assigning to its private scoped variables.There you go; you're now fully encapsulating this behavior.Full Blog Post (including jQuery considerations)",
                "Closures are hard to explain because they are used to make some behaviour work that everybody intuitively expects to work anyway.

Just replace the call in the last line by its method body (which is basically what function calls do) and you get:Now, where's the definition of x? We didn't define it in the current scope. The only solution is to let plus5 carry its scope (or rather, its parent's scope) around. This way, x is well-defined and it is bound to the value 5.",
                "TLDRA closure is a link between a function and its outer lexical (ie. as-written) environment, such that the identifiers (variables, parameters, function declarations etc) defined within that environment are visible from within the function, regardless of when or from where the function is invoked.DetailsIn the terminology of the ECMAScript specification, a closure can be said to be implemented by the [[Environment]] reference of every function-object, which points to the lexical environment within which the function is defined.When a function is invoked via the internal [[Call]] method, the [[Environment]] reference on the function-object is copied into the outer environment reference of the environment record of the newly-created execution context (stack frame).In the following example, function f closes over the lexical environment of the global execution context:In the following example, function h closes over the lexical environment of function g, which, in turn, closes over the lexical environment of the global execution context.If an inner function is returned by an outer, then the outer lexical environment will persist after the outer function has returned. This is because the outer lexical environment needs to be available if the inner function is eventually invoked.In the following example, function j closes over the lexical environment of function i, meaning that variable x is visible from inside function j, long after function i has completed execution:function i() {\r\n    var x = 'mochacchino'\r\n    return function j() {\r\n        console.log('Printing the value of x, from within function j: ', x)\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n\r\nconst k = i()\r\nsetTimeout(k, 500) // invoke k (which is j) after 500msIn a closure, the variables in the outer lexical environment themselves are available, not copies.function l() {\r\n  var y = 'vanilla';\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    setY: function(value) {\r\n      y = value;\r\n    },\r\n    logY: function(value) {\r\n      console.log('The value of y is: ', y);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst o = l()\r\no.logY() // The value of y is: vanilla\r\no.setY('chocolate')\r\no.logY() // The value of y is: chocolateThe chain of lexical environments, linked between execution contexts via outer environment references, forms a scope chain and defines the identifiers visible from any given function.Please note that in an attempt to improve clarity and accuracy, this answer has been substantially changed from the original.",

When a mom has a child, the child doesn't really own anything, right? But its parents own a house, so whenever someone asks \"Where's your home?\", the child can answer \"that house!\", and point to the house of its parents.A \"Closure\" is the ability of the child to always (even if abroad) be able to refer to its home, even though it's really the parent's who own the house.",
                "The following simple example covers all the main points of JavaScript closures.*Here is a factory that produces calculators that can add and multiply:The key point: Each call to make_calculator creates a new local variable n, which continues to be usable by that calculator's add and multiply functions long after make_calculator returns.If you are familiar with stack frames, these calculators seem strange: How can they keep accessing n after make_calculator returns?  The answer is to imagine that JavaScript doesn't use \"stack frames\", but instead uses \"heap frames\", which can persist after the function call that made them returns.Inner functions like add and multiply, which access variables declared in an outer function**, are called closures.That is pretty much all there is to closures.* For example, it covers all the points in the \"Closures for Dummies\" article given in another answer, except example 6, which simply shows that variables can be used before they are declared, a nice fact to know but completely unrelated to closures. It also covers all the points in the accepted answer, except for the points (1) that functions copy their arguments into local variables (the named function arguments), and (2) that copying numbers creates a new number, but copying an object reference gives you another reference to the same object. These are also good to know but again completely unrelated to closures. It is also very similar to the example in this answer but a bit shorter and less abstract. It does not cover the point of this answer or this comment, which is that JavaScript makes it difficult to plug the current value of a loop variable into your inner function: The \"plugging in\" step can only be done with a helper function that encloses your inner function and is invoked on each loop iteration. (Strictly speaking, the inner function accesses the helper function's copy of the variable, rather than having anything plugged in.) Again, very useful when creating closures, but not part of what a closure is or how it works. There is additional confusion due to closures working differently in functional languages like ML, where variables are bound to values rather than to storage space, providing a constant stream of people who understand closures in a way (namely the \"plugging in\" way) that is simply incorrect for JavaScript, where variables are always bound to storage space, and never to values.** Any outer function, if several are nested, or even in the global context, as this answer points out clearly.",

                "I tend to learn better by GOOD/BAD comparisons. I like to see working code followed by non-working code that someone is likely to encounter. I put together a jsFiddle that does a comparison and tries to boil down the differences to the simplest explanations I could come up with.In the above code createClosure(n) is invoked in every iteration of the loop. Note that I named the variable n to highlight that it is a new variable created in a new function scope and is not the same variable as index which is bound to the outer scope.This creates a new scope and n is bound to that scope; this means we have 10 separate scopes, one for each iteration.createClosure(n) returns a function that returns the n within that scope.Within each scope n is bound to whatever value it had when createClosure(n) was invoked so the nested function that gets returned will always return the value of n that it had when createClosure(n) was invoked.In the above code the loop was moved within the createClosureArray() function and the function now just returns the completed array, which at first glance seems more intuitive.What might not be obvious is that since createClosureArray() is only invoked once only one scope is created for this function instead of one for every iteration of the loop.Within this function a variable named index is defined. The loop runs and adds functions to the array that return index. Note that index is defined within the createClosureArray function which only ever gets invoked one time.Because there was only one scope within the createClosureArray() function, index is only bound to a value within that scope. In other words, each time the loop changes the value of index, it changes it for everything that references it within that scope.All of the functions added to the array return the SAME index variable from the parent scope where it was defined instead of 10 different ones from 10 different scopes like the first example. The end result is that all 10 functions return the same variable from the same scope.After the loop finished and index was done being modified the end value was 10, therefore every function added to the array returns the value of the single index variable which is now set to 10.CLOSURES DONE RIGHT\nn = 0\nn = 1\nn = 2\nn = 3\nn = 4\nn = 5\nn = 6\nn = 7\nn = 8\nn = 9CLOSURES DONE WRONG\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10\nn = 10",
                "Wikipedia on closures:In computer science, a closure is a function together with a referencing environment for the nonlocal names (free variables) of that function.Technically, in JavaScript, every function is a closure. It always has an access to variables defined in the surrounding scope.Since scope-defining construction in JavaScript is a function, not a code block like in many other languages, what we usually mean by closure in JavaScript is a function working with nonlocal variables defined in already executed surrounding function.Closures are often used for creating functions with some hidden private data (but it's not always the case).emsThe example above is using an anonymous function, which was executed once. But it does not have to be. It can be named (e.g. mkdb) and executed later, generating a database function each time it is invoked. Every generated function will have its own hidden database object. Another usage example of closures is when we don't return a function, but an object containing multiple functions for different purposes, each of those function having access to the same data.",

This is what closures are for functions.The secrets for JavaScript functions are the private variablesEvery time you call it, the local variable \"name\" is created and given the name \"Mary\". And every time the function exits the variable is lost and the name is forgotten.As you may guess, because the variables are re-created every time the function is called, and nobody else will know them, there must be a secret place where they are stored. It could be called Chamber of Secrets or stack or local scope but it doesn't matter. We know they are there, somewhere, hidden in the memory.But, in JavaScript, there is this very special thing that functions which are created inside other functions, can also know the local variables of their parents and keep them as long as they live.So, as long as we are in the parent -function, it can create one or more child functions which do share the secret variables from the secret place.But the sad thing is, if the child is also a private variable of its parent function, it would also die when the parent ends, and the secrets would die with them.So to live, the child has to leave before it's too lateAnd now, even though Mary is \"no longer running\", the memory of her is not lost and her child will always remember her name and other secrets they shared during their time together.So, if you call the child \"Alice\", she will respondThat's all there is to tell.",

Like here:In this case, the interpreter finds the variable in the\nouter LexicalEnvironment object.The process consists of two steps:When a function is created, it gets a hidden property, named [[Scope]], which references the current LexicalEnvironment.If a variable is read, but can not be found anywhere, an error is generated.Nested functionsFunctions can be nested one inside another, forming a chain of LexicalEnvironments which can also be called a scope chain.So, function g has access to g, a and f.ClosuresA nested function may continue to live after the outer function has finished:Marking up LexicalEnvironments:As we see, this.say is a property in the user object, so it continues to live after User completed.And if you remember, when this.say is created, it (as every function) gets an internal reference this.say.[[Scope]] to the current LexicalEnvironment. So, the LexicalEnvironment of the current User execution stays in memory. All variables of User also are its properties, so they are also carefully kept, not junked as usually.The whole point is to ensure that if the inner function wants to access an outer variable in the future, it is able to do so.To summarize:This is called a closure.",

(For simplicity's sake, I am referring to StackOverflow's Question Vote buttons, not the array of Answer Vote buttons.)When the user clicks the VoteUp button, the voteUp_click function checks whether isVotedDown == true to determine whether to vote up or merely cancel a down vote. Function voteUp_click is a closure because it is accessing its environment.All four of these functions are closures as they all access their environment.",
                "As a father of a 6-year-old, currently teaching young children (and a relative novice to coding with no formal education so corrections will be required), I think the lesson would stick best through hands-on play. If the 6-year-old is ready to understand what a closure is, then they are old enough to have a go themselves. I'd suggest pasting the code into jsfiddle.net, explaining a bit, and leaving them alone to concoct a unique song. The explanatory text below is probably more appropriate for a 10 year old.INSTRUCTIONSDATA: Data is a collection of facts. It can be numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things. You can't touch it, smell it or taste it. You can write it down, speak it and hear it. You could use it to create touch smell and taste using a computer. It can be made useful by a computer using code.CODE: All the writing above is called code. It is written in JavaScript.JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript is a language. Like English or French or Chinese are languages. There are lots of languages that are understood by computers and other electronic processors. For JavaScript to be understood by a computer it needs an interpreter. Imagine if a teacher who only speaks Russian comes to teach your class at school. When the teacher says \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f\", the class would not understand. But luckily you have a Russian pupil in your class who tells everyone this means \"everybody sit down\" - so you all do. The class is like a computer and the Russian pupil is the interpreter. For JavaScript the most common interpreter is called a browser.BROWSER: When you connect to the Internet on a computer, tablet or phone to visit a website, you use a browser. Examples you may know are Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The browser can understand JavaScript and tell the computer what it needs to do. The JavaScript instructions are called functions.FUNCTION: A function in JavaScript is like a factory. It might be a little factory with only one machine inside. Or it might contain many other little factories, each with many machines doing different jobs. In a real life clothes factory you might have reams of cloth and bobbins of thread going in and T-shirts and jeans coming out. Our JavaScript factory only processes data, it can't sew, drill a hole or melt metal. In our JavaScript factory data goes in and data comes out.All this data stuff sounds a bit boring, but it is really very cool; we might have a function that tells a robot what to make for dinner. Let's say I invite you and your friend to my house. You like chicken legs best, I like sausages, your friend always wants what you want and my friend does not eat meat.I haven't got time to go shopping, so the function needs to know what we have in the fridge to make decisions. Each ingredient has a different cooking time and we want everything to be served hot by the robot at the same time. We need to provide the function with the data about what we like, the function could 'talk' to the fridge, and the function could control the robot.A function normally has a name, parentheses and braces. Like this:Note that /*...*/ and // stop code being read by the browser.NAME: You can call a function just about whatever word you want. The example \"cookMeal\" is typical in joining two words together and giving the second one a capital letter at the beginning - but this is not necessary. It can't have a space in it, and it can't be a number on its own.PARENTHESES: \"Parentheses\" or () are the letter box on the JavaScript function factory's door or a post box in the street for sending packets of information to the factory. Sometimes the postbox might be marked for example cookMeal(you, me, yourFriend, myFriend, fridge, dinnerTime), in which case you know what data you have to give it.BRACES: \"Braces\" which look like this {} are the tinted windows of our factory. From inside the factory you can see out, but from the outside you can't see in.THE LONG CODE EXAMPLE ABOVEOur code begins with the word function, so we know that it is one! Then the name of the function sing - that's my own description of what the function is about. Then parentheses (). The parentheses are always there for a function. Sometimes they are empty, and sometimes they have something in. This one has a word in: (person). After this there is a brace like this { . This marks the start of the function sing(). It has a partner which marks the end of sing() like this }So this function might have something to do with singing, and might need some data about a person. It has instructions inside to do something with that data.Now, after the function sing(), near the end of the code is the lineVARIABLE: The letters var stand for \"variable\". A variable is like an envelope. On the outside this envelope is marked \"person\". On the inside it contains a slip of paper with the information our function needs, some letters and spaces joined together like a piece of string (it's called a string) that make a phrase reading \"an old lady\". Our envelope could contain other kinds of things like numbers (called integers), instructions (called functions), lists (called arrays). Because this variable is written outside of all the braces {}, and because you can see out through the tinted windows when you are inside the braces, this variable can be seen from anywhere in the code. We call this a 'global variable'.GLOBAL VARIABLE: person is a global variable, meaning that if you change its value from \"an old lady\" to \"a young man\", the person will keep being a young man until you decide to change it again and that any other function in the code can see that it's a young man. Press the F12 button or look at the Options settings to open the developer console of a browser and type \"person\" to see what this value is. Type person=\"a young man\" to change it and then type \"person\" again to see that it has changed.After this we have the lineThis line is calling the function, as if it were calling a dog\"Come on sing, Come and get person!\"When the browser has loaded the JavaScript code an reached this line, it will start the function. I put the line at the end to make sure that the browser has all the information it needs to run it.Functions define actions  - the main function is about singing. It contains a variable called firstPart which applies to the singing about the person that applies to each of the verses of the song: \"There was \" + person + \" who swallowed\". If you type firstPart into the console, you won't get an answer because the variable is locked up in a function - the browser can't see inside the tinted windows of the braces.CLOSURES: The closures are the smaller functions that are inside the big sing() function. The little factories inside the big factory. They each have their own braces which mean that the variables inside them can't be seen from the outside. That's why the names of the variables (creature and result) can be repeated in the closures but with different values. If you type these variable names in the console window, you won't get its value because it's hidden by two layers of tinted windows.The closures all know what the sing() function's variable called firstPart is, because they can see out from their tinted windows.After the closures come the linesThe sing() function will call each of these functions in the order they are given. Then the sing() function's work will be done.",
                "Okay, talking with a 6-year old child, I would possibly use following associations.Imagine - you are playing with your little brothers and sisters in the entire house, and you are moving around with your toys and brought some of them into your older brother's room. After a while your brother returned from the school and went to his room, and he locked inside it, so now you could not access toys left there anymore in a direct way. But you could knock the door and ask your brother for that toys. This is called toy's closure; your brother made it up for you, and he is now into outer scope.Compare with a situation when a door was locked by draft and nobody inside (general function execution), and then some local fire occur and burn down the room (garbage collector:D), and then a new room was build and now you may leave another toys there (new function instance), but never get the same toys which were left in the first room instance.For an advanced child I would put something like the following. It is not perfect, but it makes you feel about what it is:As you can see, the toys left in the room are still accessible via the brother and no matter if the room is locked. Here is a jsbin to play around with it.",
                "A function in JavaScript is not just a reference to a set of instructions (as in C language), but it also includes a hidden data structure which is composed of references to all nonlocal variables it uses (captured variables). Such two-piece functions are called closures. Every function in JavaScript can be considered a closure.Closures are functions with a state. It is somewhat similar to \"this\" in the sense that \"this\" also provides state for a function but function and \"this\" are separate objects (\"this\" is just a fancy parameter, and the only way to bind it permanently to a function is to create a closure). While \"this\" and function always live separately, a function cannot be separated from its closure and the language provides no means to access captured variables.Because all these external variables referenced by a lexically nested function are actually local variables in the chain of its lexically enclosing functions (global variables can be assumed to be local variables of some root function), and every single execution of a function creates new instances of its local variables, it follows that every execution of a function returning (or otherwise transferring it out, such as registering it as a callback) a nested function creates a new closure (with its own potentially unique set of referenced nonlocal variables which represent its execution context).Also, it must be understood that local variables in JavaScript are created not on the stack frame, but on the heap and destroyed only when no one is referencing them. When a function returns, references to its local variables are decremented, but they can still be non-null if during the current execution they became part of a closure and are still referenced by its lexically nested functions (which can happen only if the references to these nested functions were returned or otherwise transferred to some external code).An example:",
                "An answer for a six-year-old (assuming he knows what a function is and what a variable is, and what data is):Functions can return data. One kind of data you can return from a function is another function. When that new function gets returned, all the variables and arguments used in the function that created it don't go away. Instead, that parent function \"closes.\" In other words, nothing can look inside of it and see the variables it used except for the function it returned. That new function has a special ability to look back inside the function that created it and see the data inside of it.Another really simple way to explain it is in terms of scope:Any time you create a smaller scope inside of a larger scope, the smaller scope will always be able to see what is in the larger scope.",
                "Perhaps a little beyond all but the most precocious of six-year-olds, but a few examples that helped make the concept of closure in JavaScript click for me.A closure is a function that has access to another function's scope (its variables and functions). The easiest way to create a closure is with a function within a function; the reason being that in JavaScript a function always has access to its containing function\u2019s scope.function outerFunction() {\r\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\r\n    \r\n    function innerFunction() {\r\n        alert(outerVar);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    innerFunction();\r\n}\r\n\r\nouterFunction();ALERT: monkeyIn the above example, outerFunction is called which in turn calls innerFunction. Note how outerVar is available to innerFunction, evidenced by its correctly alerting the value of outerVar.Now consider the following:function outerFunction() {\r\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\r\n    \r\n    function innerFunction() {\r\n        return outerVar;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    return innerFunction;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar referenceToInnerFunction = outerFunction();\r\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());ALERT: monkeyreferenceToInnerFunction is set to outerFunction(), which simply returns a reference to innerFunction. When referenceToInnerFunction is called, it returns outerVar. Again, as above, this demonstrates that innerFunction has access to outerVar, a variable of outerFunction. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that it retains this access even after outerFunction has finished executing.And here is where things get really interesting. If we were to get rid of outerFunction, say set it to null, you might think that referenceToInnerFunction would loose its access to the value of outerVar. But this is not the case.function outerFunction() {\r\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\r\n    \r\n    function innerFunction() {\r\n        return outerVar;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    return innerFunction;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar referenceToInnerFunction = outerFunction();\r\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());\r\n\r\nouterFunction = null;\r\nalert(referenceToInnerFunction());ALERT: monkey\nALERT: monkeyBut how is this so? How can referenceToInnerFunction still know the value of outerVar now that outerFunction has been set to null?The reason that referenceToInnerFunction can still access the value of outerVar is because when the closure was first created by placing innerFunction inside of outerFunction, innerFunction added a reference to outerFunction\u2019s scope (its variables and functions) to its scope chain. What this means is that innerFunction has a pointer or reference to all of outerFunction\u2019s variables, including outerVar. So even when outerFunction has finished executing, or even if it is deleted or set to null, the variables in its scope, like outerVar, stick around in memory because of the outstanding reference to them on the part of the innerFunction that has been returned to referenceToInnerFunction. To truly release outerVar and the rest of outerFunction\u2019s variables from memory you would have to get rid of this outstanding reference to them, say by setting referenceToInnerFunction to null as well.//////////Two other things about closures to note. First, the closure will always have access to the last values of its containing function.function outerFunction() {\r\n    var outerVar = \"monkey\";\r\n    \r\n    function innerFunction() {\r\n        alert(outerVar);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    outerVar = \"gorilla\";\r\n\r\n    innerFunction();\r\n}\r\n\r\nouterFunction();ALERT: gorillaSecond, when a closure is created, it retains a reference to all of its enclosing function\u2019s variables and functions; it doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose. And but so, closures should be used sparingly, or at least carefully, as they can be memory intensive; a lot of variables can be kept in memory long after a containing function has finished executing.",

(If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).You may also find this answer helpful in this case:\nHow can I move HEAD back to a previous location?

This command will checkout to a given commit.At this point you can create a branch and start to work from this point on:You can always use the reflog as well. git reflog  will display any change which updated the HEAD and checking out the desired reflog entry will set the HEAD back to this commit.Every time the HEAD is modified there will be a new entry in the reflogThis will get you back to your desired commit.\"Move\" your HEAD back to the desired commit.This schema illustrates which command does what.

What my solution here does is NOT replace irreversibly the files you have in your working directory with files hauled up/extracted from the depths of the git repository lurking beneath your .git/ directory using fiendishly clever and diabolically powerful git commands, of which there are many. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO SUCH DEEP-SEA DIVING TO RECOVER what may appear to be a disastrous situation, and attempting to do so without sufficient expertise may prove fatal.Copy the whole directory and call it something else, like \"my project - copy\". Assuming your git repository (\"repo\") files are under the \"my project\" directory (the default place for them, under a directory called \".git\"), you will now have copied both your work files and your repo files.Do this in the directory \"my project\":This will return the state of the repo under \"my project\" to what it was when you made that commit (a \"commit\" means a snapshot of your working files). All commits since the \"resetted\" commit will be lost forever under \"my project\", BUT... they will still be present in the repo under \"my project - copy\" since you copied all those files - including the ones in the repo, under .../.git/.You then have two versions on your system... you can examine or copy or modify files of interest, or whatever, from the previous commit. You can completely discard the files under \"my project - copy\", if you have decided the new work since the restored commit was going nowhere...The obvious thing if you want to carry on with the state of the project without actually discarding the work since this retrieved commit is to rename your directory again: Delete the project containing the retrieved commit (or give it a temporary name) and rename your \"my project - copy\" directory back to \"my project\". Then maybe try to understand some of the other answers here, and probably do another commit fairly soon.Git is a brilliant creation but absolutely no-one is able to just \"pick it up on the fly\": also people who try to explain it far too often assume prior knowledge of other VCS [Version Control Systems] and delve far too deep far too soon, and commit other terrible crimes, like using interchangeable terms for \"checking out\" - in ways which sometimes appear almost calculated to confuse a beginner.To save yourself much stress, learn from my scars. You have to pretty much have to read a book on Git - I'd recommend reading THE BOOK, Pro Git 2nd edition: available for free download etc. from git central. Published 2014 but, as at early 2022, still the best. Do it sooner rather than later: Git is destined to be part of your life from now on. If you do, bear in mind that much of the complexity of Git comes from branching and then remerging: the Pro Git book actually introduces this central aspect very gently, but you can skip those parts in any book on your first read. From your question there's no reason why people should be blinding you with science.Especially if, for example, this is a desperate situation and you're a newbie with Git!PS: (slight caution) One other thought: It is (now) actually quite simple to keep the Git repo in a directory other than the one with the working files. This would mean you would not copy the entire Git repository using the above quick & dirty solution. See the answer by Fryer using --separate-git-dir here. Bearing that in mind, be warned: If you have a \"separate-directory\" repository which you don't copy, and you do a hard reset, all versions subsequent to the reset commit really will be lost forever forever, unless you have, as you absolutely should, regularly backed up your repository, preferably to the Cloud (e.g. Google Drive) among other places.On this subject of \"backing up to the Cloud\", the next step is to open an account (free of course) with GitHub or (better in my view) GitLab. You can then regularly do a git push command to make your Cloud repo up-to-date \"properly\". But again, talking about this may be too much too soon: git push has to be configured, can fail to work for a totally baffling technical reason, involves learning about remote repos (\"origin\", etc). So a quick-and-dirty Cloud-based backup approach may be preferable until you become knowledgeable. Again, the Pro Git book introduces how remote repositories work, and relate to your local repo, very gently and rationally.",

                "The terms \"pass-by-value\" and \"pass-by-reference\" have special, precisely defined meanings in computer science. These meanings differ from the intuition many people have when first hearing the terms. Much of the confusion in this discussion seems to come from this fact.The terms \"pass-by-value\" and \"pass-by-reference\" are talking about variables. Pass-by-value means that the value of a variable is passed to a function/method. Pass-by-reference means that a reference to that variable is passed to the function. The latter gives the function a way to change the contents of the variable.By those definitions, Java is always pass-by-value.  Unfortunately, when we deal with variables holding objects we are really dealing with object-handles called references which are passed-by-value as well.  This terminology and semantics easily confuse many beginners.It goes like this:In the example above aDog.getName() will still return \"Max\". The value aDog within main is not changed in the function foo with the Dog \"Fifi\" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return \"Fifi\" after the call to foo.Likewise:In the above example, Fifi is the dog's name after call to foo(aDog) because the object's name was set inside of foo(...). Any operations that foo performs on d are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on aDog, but it is not possible to change the value of the variable aDog itself.For more information on pass by reference and pass by value, consult the following answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/430958/6005228. This explains more thoroughly the semantics and history behind the two and also explains why Java and many other modern languages appear to do both in certain cases.",
                "I just noticed you referenced my article.The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as \"pass-by-reference\" in Java.The key to understanding this is that something likeis not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog. The use of the term \"reference\" in Java is very misleading and is what causes most of the confusion here. What they call \"references\" act/feel more like what we'd call \"pointers\" in most other languages.What that means, is when you haveyou're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.(I say essentially because Java pointers/references aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way.)Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.if the Method were defined aslet's look at what's happening.Now let's think about what happens outside the method:Did myDog change?There's the key.Keeping in mind that myDog is a pointer, and not an actual Dog, the answer is NO. myDog still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original Dog (but note that because of line \"AAA\", its name is now \"Max\" - still the same Dog; myDog's value has not changed.)It's perfectly valid to follow an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, the caller will not see any changes you make to where that pointer points. (In a language with pass-by-reference semantics, the method function can change the pointer and the caller will see that change.)In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the foo method we defined above would have changed where myDog was pointing when it assigned someDog on line BBB.Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.A discussion in the comments warrants some clarification...In C, you can writeThis is not a special case in C. Both languages use pass-by-value semantics. Here the call site is creating additional data structure to assist the function to access and manipulate data.The function is being passed pointers to data, and follows those pointers to access and modify that data.A similar approach in Java, where the caller sets up assisting structure, might be:(or if you wanted both examples to demonstrate features the other language doesn't have, create a mutable IntWrapper class to use in place of the arrays)In these cases, both C and Java are simulating pass-by-reference. They're still both passing values (pointers to ints or arrays), and following those pointers inside the called function to manipulate the data.Pass-by-reference is all about the function declaration/definition, and how it handles its parameters. Reference semantics apply to every call to that function, and the call site only needs to pass variables, no additional data structure.These simulations require the call site and the function to cooperate. No doubt it's useful, but it's still pass-by-value.",
                "Java always passes arguments by value, NOT by reference.Let me explain this through an example:I will explain this in steps:Declaring a reference named f of type Foo and assign it a new object of type Foo with an attribute \"f\".From the method side, a reference of type Foo with a name a is declared and it's initially assigned null.As you call the method changeReference, the reference a will be assigned the object which is passed as an argument.Declaring a reference named b of type Foo and assign it a new object of type Foo with an attribute \"b\".a = b makes a new assignment to the reference a, not f, of the object whose attribute is \"b\".As you call modifyReference(Foo c) method, a reference c is created and assigned the object with attribute \"f\".c.setAttribute(\"c\"); will change the attribute of the object that reference c points to it, and it's the same object that reference f points to it.I hope you understand now how passing objects as arguments works in Java :)",
                "Java is always pass by value, with no exceptions, ever.So how is it that anyone can be at all confused by this, and believe that Java is pass by reference, or think they have an example of Java acting as pass by reference? The key point is that Java never provides direct access to the values of objects themselves, in any circumstances. The only access to objects is through a reference to that object. Because Java objects are always accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables and method arguments as being objects, when pedantically they are only references to objects. The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.So, when calling a methodSo if you have doSomething(foo) and public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. } the two Foos have copied references that point to the same objects.Naturally, passing by value a reference to an object looks very much like (and is indistinguishable in practice from) passing an object by reference.",
                "This will give you some insights of how Java really works to the point that in your next discussion about Java passing by reference or passing by value you'll just smile :-)Step one please erase from your mind that word that starts with 'p' \"_ _ _ _ _ _ _\", especially if you come from other programming languages. Java and 'p' cannot be written in the same book, forum, or even txt.Step two remember that when you pass an Object into a method you're passing the Object reference and not the Object itself.Now think of what an Object's reference/variable does/is:In the following (please don't try to compile/execute this...):What happens?A picture is worth a thousand words:Note that the anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject arrows is directed towards the Object and not towards the variable person!If you didn't get it then just trust me and remember that it's better to say that Java is pass by value. Well, pass by reference value. Oh well, even better is pass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value! ;)Now feel free to hate me but note that given this there is no difference between passing primitive data types and Objects when talking about method arguments.You always pass a copy of the bits of the value of the reference!Java is pass-by-value because inside a method you can modify the referenced Object as much as you want but no matter how hard you try you'll never be able to modify the passed variable that will keep referencing (not p _ _ _ _ _ _ _) the same Object no matter what!The changeName function above will never be able to modify the actual content (the bit values) of the passed reference. In other word changeName cannot make Person person refer to another Object.Of course you can cut it short and just say that  Java is pass-by-value!",
                "Java passes references by value.So you can't change the reference that gets passed in.",
                "I feel like arguing about \"pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value\" is not super-helpful.If you say, \"Java is pass-by-whatever (reference/value)\", in either case, you're not provide a complete answer. Here's some additional information that will hopefully aid in understanding what's happening in memory.Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:\nValues go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.\nMemory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.Okay. First off, local primitives go on the stack. So this code:results in this:When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are against the word \"pointer\". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes on the stack.Like so:An array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.So, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you're actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the \"value\" of the address, and some say it's just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between \"reference\" and \"value\" proponents. What you call it isn't as important as that you understand that what's getting passed in is the address to the object.One String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier hisName, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call shout(): a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, name is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.So, value, reference? You say \"potato\".",
                "Basically, reassigning Object parameters doesn't affect the argument, e.g.,will print out \"Hah!\" instead of null. The reason this works is because bar is a copy of the value of baz, which is just a reference to \"Hah!\". If it were the actual reference itself, then foo would have redefined baz to null.",
                "Just to show the contrast, compare the following C++ and Java snippets:In C++: Note: Bad code - memory leaks!  But it demonstrates the point.In Java,Java only has the two types of passing: by value for built-in types, and by value of the pointer for object types.",
                "Java passes references to objects by value.",
                "I can't believe that nobody mentioned Barbara Liskov yet. When she designed CLU in 1974, she ran into this same terminology problem, and she invented the term call by sharing (also known as call by object-sharing and call by object) for this specific case of \"call by value where the value is a reference\".",
                "The crux of the matter is that the word reference in the expression \"pass by reference\" means something completely different from the usual meaning of the word reference in Java.Usually in Java reference means a a reference to an object. But the technical terms pass by reference/value from programming language theory is talking about a reference to the memory cell holding the variable, which is something completely different.",
                "There are already great answers that cover this. I wanted to make a small contribution by sharing a very simple example (which will compile) contrasting the behaviors between Pass-by-reference in c++ and Pass-by-value in Java.A few points:C++ pass by reference example:Java pass \"a Java reference\" by value exampleEDITSeveral people have written comments which seem to indicate that either they are not looking at my examples or they don't get the c++ example. Not sure where the disconnect is, but guessing the c++ example is not clear. I'm posting the same example in pascal because I think pass-by-reference looks cleaner in pascal, but I could be wrong. I might just be confusing people more; I hope not.In pascal, parameters passed-by-reference are called \"var parameters\". In the procedure setToNil below, please note the keyword 'var' which precedes the parameter 'ptr'. When a pointer is passed to this procedure, it will be passed by reference. Note the behavior: when this procedure sets ptr to nil (that's pascal speak for NULL), it will set the argument to nil--you can't do that in Java.EDIT 2Some excerpts from \"THE Java Programming Language\" by Ken Arnold, James Gosling (the guy who invented Java), and David Holmes, chapter 2, section 2.6.5All parameters to methods are passed \"by value\". In other words,\nvalues of parameter variables in a method are copies of the invoker\nspecified as arguments.He goes on to make the same point regarding objects . . .You should note that when the parameter is an object reference, it is\nthe object reference-not the object itself-that is passed \"by value\".And towards the end of the same section he makes a broader statement about java being only pass by value and never pass by reference.The Java programming language does not pass objects by reference; it\npasses object references by value. Because two copies of the same\nreference refer to the same actual object, changes made through one\nreference variable are visible through the other. There is exactly one\nparameter passing mode-pass by value-and that helps keep things\nsimple.This section of the book has a great explanation of parameter passing in Java and of the distinction between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value and it's by the creator of Java. I would encourage anyone to read it, especially if you're still not convinced.I think the difference between the two models is very subtle and unless you've done programming where you actually used pass-by-reference, it's easy to miss where two models differ.I hope this settles the debate, but probably won't.EDIT 3I might be a little obsessed with this post. Probably because I feel that the makers of Java inadvertently spread misinformation. If instead of using the word \"reference\" for pointers they had used something else, say\ndingleberry, there would've been no problem. You could say, \"Java passes dingleberries by value and not by reference\", and nobody would be confused.That's the reason only Java developers have issue with this. They look at the word \"reference\" and think they know exactly what that means, so they don't even bother to consider the opposing argument.Anyway, I noticed a comment in an older post, which made a balloon analogy which I really liked. So much so that I decided to glue together some clip-art to make a set of cartoons to illustrate the point.Passing a reference by value--Changes to the reference are not reflected in the caller's scope, but the changes to the object are. This is because the reference is copied, but the both the original and the copy refer to the same object.Pass by reference--There is no copy of the reference. Single reference is shared by both the caller and the function being called. Any changes to the reference or the Object's data are reflected in the caller's scope.EDIT 4I have seen posts on this topic which describe the low level implementation of parameter passing in Java, which I think is great and very helpful because it makes an abstract idea concrete. However, to me the question is more about the behavior described in the language specification than about the technical implementation of the behavior. This is an exerpt from the Java Language Specification, section 8.4.1 :When the method or constructor is invoked (\u00a715.12), the values of the\nactual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\nvariables, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\nthe method or constructor. The Identifier that appears in the\nDeclaratorId may be used as a simple name in the body of the method or\nconstructor to refer to the formal parameter.Which means, java creates a copy of the passed parameters before executing a method. Like most people who studied compilers in college, I used \"The Dragon Book\" which is THE compilers book. It has a good description of \"Call-by-value\" and \"Call-by-Reference\" in Chapter 1. The Call-by-value description matches up with Java Specs exactly.Back when I studied compilers-in the 90's, I used the first edition of the book from 1986 which pre-dated Java by about 9 or 10 years. However, I just ran across a copy of the 2nd Eddition from 2007 which actually mentions Java! Section 1.6.6 labeled \"Parameter Passing Mechanisms\" describes parameter passing pretty nicely. Here is an excerpt under the heading \"Call-by-value\" which mentions Java:In call-by-value, the actual parameter is evaluated (if it is an\nexpression) or copied (if it is a variable). The value is placed in\nthe location belonging to the corresponding formal parameter of the\ncalled procedure. This method is used in C and Java, and is a common\noption in C++ , as well as in most other languages.",
                "In java everything is reference, so when you have something like:\n    Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0); Java does following:Java doesn't pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.

                "Java is always pass by value, not pass by referenceFirst of all, we need to understand what pass by value and pass by reference are.Pass by value means that you are making a copy in memory of the actual parameter's value that is passed in. This is a copy of the contents of the actual parameter.Pass by reference (also called pass by address) means that a copy of the address of the actual parameter is stored.Sometimes Java can give the illusion of pass by reference. Let's see how it works by using the example below:The output of this program is:Let's understand step by step:As we all know it will create an object in the heap and return the reference value back to t. For example, suppose the value of t is 0x100234 (we don't know the actual JVM internal value, this is just an example) .When passing reference t to the function it will not directly pass the actual reference value of object test,  but it will create a copy of t and then pass it to the function. Since it is passing by value, it passes a copy of the variable rather than the actual reference of it. Since we said the value of t was 0x100234, both t and f will have the same value and hence they will point to the same object.If you change anything in the function using reference f it will modify the existing contents of the object. That is why we got the output changevalue,   which is updated in the function.To understand this more clearly, consider the following example:Will this throw a NullPointerException? No, because it only passes a copy of the reference.\nIn the case of passing by reference, it could have thrown a NullPointerException, as seen below:Hopefully this will help.",
                "Java is a pass by value(stack memory)How it worksLet's first understand that where java stores primitive data type and object data type.Primitive data types itself and object references are stored in the stack.\nObjects themselves are stored in the heap.It means, Stack memory stores primitive data types and also the\naddresses of objects.And you always pass a copy of the bits of the value of the reference.If it's a primitive data type then these copied bits contain the value of the primitive data type itself, That's why when we change the value of argument inside the method then it does not reflect the changes outside.If it's an object data type like Foo foo=new Foo() then in this case copy of the address of the object passes like file shortcut  , suppose we have a text file abc.txt at C:\\desktop and suppose we make shortcut of the same file and put this inside C:\\desktop\\abc-shortcut so when you access the file from C:\\desktop\\abc.txt and write 'Stack Overflow' and close the file and again you open the file from shortcut then you write ' is the largest online community for programmers to learn' then total file change will be 'Stack Overflow is the largest online community for programmers to learn' which means it doesn't matter from where you open the file , each time we were accessing the same file , here we can assume Foo as a file and suppose foo stored at 123hd7h(original address like C:\\desktop\\abc.txt ) address and 234jdid(copied address like C:\\desktop\\abc-shortcut which actually contains the original address of the file inside) ..\nSo for better understanding make shortcut file and feel.",
                "Getting an outside of the box view, let's look at Assembly or some low level memory management. At the CPU level a reference to anything immediately becomes a value if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why pointer is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).Data in memory has a Location and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a Name to certain Location (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces Name with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.Down to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).Lets say we have a variable Foo, its Location is at the 47th byte in memory and its Value is 5. We have another variable Ref2Foo which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. This Ref2Foo might be a technical variable, not explicitly created by the program. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see just two Values.\nIf you use them as references then to reach to 5 we have to travel:This is how jump-tables work.If we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo's value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method, depending on the language and its several method invocation modes:In every cases above a value - a copy of an existing value - has been created, it is now upto the receiving method to handle it. When you write \"Foo\" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  dereferenced, or double dereferenced, the process depends on how the language works and/or what the type of Foo dictates. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a reference is a value when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (at language level).Now we have passed Foo to the method:Nitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only pass-by-reference.Strict pass-by-value is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to be copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller's view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.So in short and in Java's own terminology, Java is pass-by-value where value can be: either a real value or a value that is a representation of a reference.",
                "In Java, method arguments are all passed by value :Java arguments are all passed by value (the value  or reference is copied when used by the method) :In the case of primitive types, Java behaviour is simple:\nThe value is copied in another instance of the primitive type.In case of Objects, this is the same:\nObject variables are references (mem buckets holding only Object\u2019s address instead of a primitive value) that was created using the \"new\" keyword, and are copied like primitive types.The behaviour can appear different from primitive types: Because the copied object-variable contains the same address (to the same Object).\nObject's content/members might still be modified within a method and later access outside, giving the illusion that the (containing) Object itself was passed by reference.\"String\" Objects appear to be a good counter-example to the urban legend saying that \"Objects are passed by reference\":In effect, using a method, you will never be able, to update the value of a String passed as argument:A String Object, holds characters by an array declared final that can't be modified.\nOnly the address of the Object might be replaced by another using \"new\".\nUsing \"new\" to update the variable, will not let the Object be accessed from outside, since the variable was initially passed by value and copied.",

This means for primitive datatypes you will work with an copy and for objects you will work with an copy of the reference to the objects.

But if your objects are not immutable you can change it for example:This will populate Hello World on the command line. If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable. For example:However you could make a wrapper for String like this which would make it able to use it with Strings:edit: i believe this is also the reason to use StringBuffer when it comes to \"adding\" two Strings because you can modifie the original object which u can't with immutable objects like String is.",

                "I thought I'd contribute this answer to add more details from the Specifications.First, What's the difference between passing by reference vs. passing by value?Passing by reference means the called functions' parameter will be the\nsame as the callers' passed argument (not the value, but the identityPass by value means the called functions' parameter will be a copy of\nthe callers' passed argument.Or from wikipedia, on the subject of pass-by-referenceIn call-by-reference evaluation (also referred to as\npass-by-reference), a function receives an implicit reference to a\nvariable used as argument, rather than a copy of its value. This\ntypically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\nvariable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.And on the subject of pass-by-valueIn call-by-value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the\nresulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function [...].\nIf the function or procedure is able to assign values to its\nparameters, only its local copy is assigned [...].Second, we need to know what Java uses in its method invocations. The Java Language Specification statesWhen the method or constructor is invoked (\u00a715.12), the values of the\nactual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\nvariables, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\nthe method or constructor.So it assigns (or binds) the value of the argument to the corresponding parameter variable.What is the value of the argument?Let's consider reference types, the Java Virtual Machine Specification statesThere are three kinds of reference types: class types, array types,\nand interface types. Their values are references to dynamically\ncreated class instances, arrays, or class instances or arrays that\nimplement interfaces, respectively.The Java Language Specification also statesThe reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers to no object.The value of an argument (of some reference type) is a pointer to an object. Note that a variable, an invocation of a method with a reference type return type, and an instance creation expression (new ...) all resolve to a reference type value.Soall bind the value of a reference to a String instance to the method's newly created parameter, param. This is exactly what the definition of pass-by-value describes. As such, Java is pass-by-value.The fact that you can follow the reference to invoke a method or access a field of the referenced object is completely irrelevant to the conversation. The definition of pass-by-reference wasThis typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\nvariable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.In Java, modifying the variable means reassigning it. In Java, if you reassigned the variable within the method, it would go unnoticed to the caller. Modifying the object referenced by the variable is a different concept entirely.Primitive values are also defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification, here. The value of the type is the corresponding integral or floating point value, encoded appropriately (8, 16, 32, 64, etc. bits).",
                "You can never pass by reference in Java, and one of the ways that is obvious is when you want to return more than one value from a method call. Consider the following bit of code in C++:Sometimes you want to use the same pattern in Java, but you can't; at least not directly. Instead you could do something like this:As was explained in previous answers, in Java you're passing a pointer to the array as a value into getValues. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you're expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn't necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set. But the simple pattern available to you in C++ above is not available in Java.",
                "The distinction, or perhaps just the way I remember as I used to be under the same impression as the original poster is this: Java is always pass by value. All objects( in Java, anything except for primitives) in Java are references. These references are passed by value.",
                "As many people mentioned it before, Java is always pass-by-valueHere is another example that will help you understand the difference (the classic swap example):Prints:Before: a = 2, b = 3\n  After: a = 2, b = 3This happens because iA and iB are new local reference variables that have the same value of the passed references (they point to a and b respectively). So, trying to change the references of iA or iB will only change in the local scope and not outside of this method.",
                "I always think of it as \"pass by copy\". It is a copy of the value be it primitive or reference. If it is a primitive it is a copy of the bits that are the value and if it is an Object it is a copy of the reference.output of java PassByCopy:name= Maxx\n  name= FidoPrimitive wrapper classes and Strings are immutable so any example using those types will not work the same as other types/objects.",
                "Unlike some other languages, Java does not allow you to choose between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference\u2014all arguments are passed by value. A method call can pass two types of values to a method\u2014copies of primitive values (e.g., values of int and double) and copies of references to objects.When a method modifies a primitive-type parameter, changes to the parameter have no effect on the original argument value in the calling method.When it comes to objects, objects themselves cannot be passed to methods. So we pass the reference(address) of the object. We can manipulate the original object using this reference.How Java creates and stores objects: When we create an object we store the object\u2019s address in a reference variable. Let's analyze the following statement.\u201cAccount account1\u201d is the type and name of the reference variable, \u201c=\u201d is the assignment operator, \u201cnew\u201d asks for the required amount of space from the system. The constructor to the right of keyword new which creates the object is called implicitly by the keyword new. Address of the created object(result of right value, which is an expression called \"class instance creation expression\") is assigned to the left value (which is a reference variable with a name and a type specified) using the assign operator.Although an object\u2019s reference is passed by value, a method can still interact with the referenced object by calling its public methods using the copy of the object\u2019s reference. Since the reference stored in the parameter is a copy of the reference that was passed as an argument, the parameter in the called method and the argument in the calling method refer to the same object in memory.Passing references to arrays, instead of the array objects themselves, makes sense for performance reasons. Because everything in Java is passed by value, if array objects were passed,\na copy of each element would be passed. For large arrays, this would waste time and consume\nconsiderable storage for the copies of the elements.In the image below you can see we have two reference variables(These are called pointers in C/C++, and I think that term makes it easier to understand this feature.) in the main method. Primitive and reference variables are kept in stack memory(left side in images below). array1 and array2 reference variables \"point\" (as C/C++ programmers call it) or reference to a and b arrays respectively, which are objects (values these reference variables hold are addresses of objects) in heap memory (right side in images below).If we pass the value of array1 reference variable as an argument to the reverseArray method, a reference variable is created in the method and that reference variable starts pointing to the same array (a).So, if we sayin reverseArray method, it will make a change in array a.We have another reference variable in reverseArray method (array2) that points to an array c. If we were to sayin reverseArray method, then the reference variable array1 in method reverseArray would stop pointing to array a and start pointing to array c (Dotted line in second image).If we return value of reference variable array2 as the return value of method reverseArray and assign this value to reference variable array1 in main method, array1 in main will start pointing to array c.So let's write all the things we have done at once now.And now that reverseArray method is over, its reference variables(array1 and array2) are gone. Which means we now only have the two reference variables in main method array1 and array2 which point to c and b arrays respectively. No reference variable is pointing to object (array) a. So it is eligible for garbage collection.You could also assign value of array2 in main to array1. array1 would start pointing to b.",
                "Java has only pass by value. A very simple example to validate this.",
                "To make a long story short, Java objects have some very peculiar properties.In general, Java has primitive types (int, bool, char, double, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from java.lang.Object). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. void foo(int x) passes an int by value. void foo(int *x) is a function that does not want an int a, but a pointer to an int: foo(&a). One would use this with the & operator to pass a variable address.Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: void foo(int &x) is called by foo(a), where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference a should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.",

It only makes Git ignore the file in the present/future.This method makes Git completely forget ignored files (past/present/future), but it does not delete anything from the working directory (even when re-pulled from remote).This method requires usage of file /.git/info/exclude (preferred) or a pre-existing .gitignore in all the commits that have files to be ignored/forgotten. 1All methods of enforcing Git ignore behavior after-the-fact effectively rewrite history and thus have significant ramifications for any public/shared/collaborative repositories that might be pulled after this process. 2General advice: start with a clean repository - everything committed, nothing pending in working directory or index, and make a backup!Also, the comments/revision history of this answer (and revision history of this question) may be useful/enlightening.Finally, follow the rest of this GitHub guide (starting at step 6) which includes important warnings/information about the commands below.Other developers that pull from the now-modified remote repository should make a backup and then:1 Because /.git/info/exclude can be applied to all historical commits using the instructions above, perhaps details about getting a .gitignore file into the historical commit(s) that need it is beyond the scope of this answer.

Others may not care since /.git/info/exclude can accomplish the same thing regardless where the .gitignore file exists in the commit history, and clearly rewriting history is a very touchy subject, even when aware of the ramifications.FWIW, potential methods may include git rebase or a git filter-branch that copies an external .gitignore into each commit, like the answers to this question.2 Enforcing Git ignore behavior after-the-fact by committing the results of a stand-alone git rm --cached command may result in newly-ignored file deletion in future pulls from the force-pushed remote. The --prune-empty flag in the following git filter-branch command avoids this problem by automatically removing the previous \"delete all ignored files\" index-only commit.

Also, the colon sign : already has many uses in Python.

But this isn't the most succinct way - see the last example.With Python, you can simply use or for alternative assignments.The above works since li1 is None and the interpreter treats that as False in logic expressions. The interpreter then moves on and evaluates the second expression, which is not None and it's not an empty list - so it gets assigned to a.This also works with empty lists. For instance, if you want to assign a whichever list has items.Knowing this, you can simply such assignments whenever you encounter them. This also works with strings and other iterables. You could assign a whichever string isn't empty.I always liked the C ternary syntax, but Python takes it a step further!I understand that some may say this isn't a good stylistic choice, because it relies on mechanics that aren't immediately apparent to all developers. I personally disagree with that viewpoint. Python is a syntax-rich language with lots of idiomatic tricks that aren't immediately apparent to the dabbler.

But it will be defined inside its body:If you want to alias functions on all browsers, use this kind of declaration:In this case, both xyz and abc are aliases of the same object:One compelling reason to use the combined style is the \"name\" attribute of function objects (not supported by Internet\u00a0Explorer). Basically when you define a function likeits name is automatically assigned. But when you define it likeits name is empty \u2014 we created an anonymous function and assigned it to some variable.Another good reason to use the combined style is to use a short internal name to refer to itself, while providing a long non-conflicting name for external users:In the example above we can do the same with an external name, but it'll be too unwieldy (and slower).(Another way to refer to itself is to use arguments.callee, which is still relatively long, and not supported in the strict mode.)Deep down, JavaScript treats both statements differently. This is a function declaration:abc here is defined everywhere in the current scope:Also, it hoisted through a return statement:This is a function expression:xyz here is defined from the point of assignment:Function declaration vs. function expression is the real reason why there is a difference demonstrated by Greg.Fun fact:Personally, I prefer the \"function expression\" declaration because this way I can control the visibility. When I define the function likeI know that I defined the function locally. When I define the function likeI know that I defined it globally providing that I didn't define abc anywhere in the chain of scopes. This style of definition is resilient even when used inside eval(). While the definitiondepends on the context and may leave you guessing where it is actually defined, especially in the case of eval() \u2014 the answer is: It depends on the browser.",
                "Here's the rundown on the standard forms that create functions: (Originally written for another question, but adapted after being moved into the canonical question.)Terms:The quick list:Function Declaration\"Anonymous\" function Expression (which despite the term, sometimes create functions with names)Named function ExpressionAccessor Function Initializer (ES5+)Arrow Function Expression (ES2015+) (which, like anonymous function expressions, don't involve an explicit name, and yet can create functions with names)Method Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)Constructor and Method Declarations in class (ES2015+)The first form is a function declaration, which looks like this:A function declaration is a declaration; it's not a statement or expression. As such, you don't follow it with a ; (although doing so is harmless).A function declaration is processed when execution enters the context in which it appears, before any step-by-step code is executed. The function it creates is given a proper name (x in the example above), and that name is put in the scope in which the declaration appears.Because it's processed before any step-by-step code in the same context, you can do things like this:Until ES2015, the spec didn't cover what a JavaScript engine should do if you put a function declaration inside a control structure like try, if, switch, while, etc., like this:And since they're processed before step-by-step code is run, it's tricky to know what to do when they're in a control structure.Although doing this wasn't specified until ES2015, it was an allowable extension to support function declarations in blocks. Unfortunately (and inevitably), different engines did different things.As of ES2015, the specification says what to do. In fact, it gives three separate things to do:The rules for the loose modes are tricky, but in strict mode, function declarations in blocks are easy: They're local to the block (they have block scope, which is also new in ES2015), and they're hoisted to the top of the block. So:The second common form is called an anonymous function expression:Like all expressions, it's evaluated when it's reached in the step-by-step execution of the code.In ES5, the function this creates has no name (it's anonymous). In ES2015, the function is assigned a name if possible by inferring it from context. In the example above, the name would be y. Something similar is done when the function is the value of a property initializer. (For details on when this happens and the rules, search for SetFunctionName in the the specification\u00a0\u2014 it appears all over the place.)The third form is a named function expression (\"NFE\"):The function this creates has a proper name (w in this case). Like all expressions, this is evaluated when it's reached in the step-by-step execution of the code. The name of the function is not added to the scope in which the expression appears; the name is in scope within the function itself:Note that NFEs have frequently been a source of bugs for JavaScript implementations. IE8 and earlier, for instance, handle NFEs completely incorrectly, creating two different functions at two different times. Early versions of Safari had issues as well. The good news is that current versions of browsers (IE9 and up, current Safari) don't have those issues any more. (But as of this writing, sadly, IE8 remains in widespread use, and so using NFEs with code for the web in general is still problematic.)Sometimes functions can sneak in largely unnoticed; that's the case with accessor functions. Here's an example:Note that when I used the function, I didn't use ()! That's because it's an accessor function for a property. We get and set the property in the normal way, but behind the scenes, the function is called.You can also create accessor functions with Object.defineProperty, Object.defineProperties, and the lesser-known second argument to Object.create.ES2015 brings us the arrow function. Here's one example:See that n => n * 2 thing hiding in the map() call? That's a function.A couple of things about arrow functions:They don't have their own this. Instead, they close over the this of the context where they're defined. (They also close over arguments and, where relevant, super.) This means that the this within them is the same as the this where they're created, and cannot be changed.As you'll have noticed with the above, you don't use the keyword function; instead, you use =>.The n => n * 2 example above is one form of them. If you have multiple arguments to pass the function, you use parens:(Remember that Array#map passes the entry as the first argument, and the index as the second.)In both cases, the body of the function is just an expression; the function's return value will automatically be the result of that expression (you don't use an explicit return).If you're doing more than just a single expression, use {} and an explicit return (if you need to return a value), as normal:The version without { ... } is called an arrow function with an expression body or concise body. (Also: A concise arrow function.) The one with { ... } defining the body is an arrow function with a function body. (Also: A verbose arrow function.)ES2015 allows a shorter form of declaring a property that references a function called a method definition; it looks like this:the almost-equivalent in ES5 and earlier would be:the difference (other than verbosity) is that a method can use super, but a function cannot. So for instance, if you had an object that defined (say) valueOf using method syntax, it could use super.valueOf() to get the value Object.prototype.valueOf would have returned (before presumably doing something else with it), whereas the ES5 version would have to do Object.prototype.valueOf.call(this) instead.That also means that the method has a reference to the object it was defined on, so if that object is temporary (for instance, you're passing it into Object.assign as one of the source objects), method syntax could mean that the object is retained in memory when otherwise it could have been garbage collected (if the JavaScript engine doesn't detect that situation and handle it if none of the methods uses super).ES2015 brings us class syntax, including declared constructors and methods:There are two function declarations above: One for the constructor, which gets the name Person, and one for getFullName, which is a function assigned to Person.prototype.",
                "Speaking about the global context, both, the var statement and a FunctionDeclaration at the end will create a non-deleteable property on the global object, but the value of both can be overwritten.The subtle difference between the two ways is that when the Variable Instantiation process runs (before the actual code execution) all identifiers declared with var will be initialized with undefined, and the ones used by the FunctionDeclaration's will be available since that moment, for example:The assignment of the bar FunctionExpression takes place until runtime.A global property created by a FunctionDeclaration can be overwritten without any problems just like a variable value, e.g.:Another obvious difference between your two examples is that the first function doesn't have a name, but the second has it, which can be really useful when debugging (i.e. inspecting a call stack).About your edited first example (foo = function() { alert('hello!'); };), it is an undeclared assignment, I would highly encourage you to always use the var keyword.With an assignment, without the var statement, if the referenced identifier is not found in the scope chain, it will become a deleteable property of the global object.Also, undeclared assignments throw a ReferenceError on ECMAScript 5 under Strict Mode.A must read:Note: This answer has been merged from another question, in which the major doubt and misconception from the OP was that identifiers declared with a FunctionDeclaration, couldn't be overwritten which is not the case.",

As you can see, there is a noticeable difference when there should be none. If you are really a performance freak like me, then it might be more worth your while trying to reduce the number of variables and functions in the scope and especially eliminating polymorphism (such as using the same variable to store two different types).When you use the var keyword to declare a variable, you can then reassign a different value to the variable like so.(function(){\n    \"use strict\";\n    var foobar = function(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = \"Hello World!\"; // new value\n        console.log(\"[no error]\");\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(\"ERROR: \" + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();However, when we use the const-statement, the variable reference becomes immutable. This means that we cannot assign a new value to the variable. Please note, however, that this does not make the contents of the variable immutable: if you do const arr = [], then you can still do arr[10] = \"example\". Only doing something like arr = \"new value\" or arr = [] would throw an error as seen below.(function(){\n    \"use strict\";\n    const foobar = function(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = \"Hello World!\"; // new value\n        console.log(\"[no error]\");\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(\"ERROR: \" + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();Interestingly, if we declare the variable as function funcName(){}, then the immutability of the variable is the same as declaring it with var.(function(){\n    \"use strict\";\n    function foobar(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = \"Hello World!\"; // new value\n        console.log(\"[no error]\");\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(\"ERROR: \" + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();The \"nearest block\" is the nearest \"function,\" (including asynchronous functions, generator functions, and asynchronous generator functions).

                "A function declaration and a function expression assigned to a variable behave the same once the binding is established.There is a difference however at how and when the function object is actually associated with its variable. This difference is due to the mechanism called variable hoisting in JavaScript.Basically, all function declarations and variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the function in which the declaration occurs (this is why we say that JavaScript has function scope).When a function declaration is hoisted, the function body \"follows\"\nso when the function body is evaluated, the variable will immediately\nbe bound to a function object.When a variable declaration is hoisted, the initialization does not\nfollow, but is \"left behind\".

(Actually, it will be assigned a value at every location where a declaration of a variable with the same name occurs.)The order of hoisting is also important: function declarations take precedence over variable declarations with the same name, and the last function declaration takes precedence over previous function declarations with the same name.Some examples...Variable foo is hoisted to the top of the function, initialized to undefined, so that !foo is true, so foo is assigned 10. The foo outside of bar's scope plays no role and is untouched.Function declarations take precedence over variable declarations, and the last function declaration \"sticks\".In this example a is initialized with the function object resulting from evaluating the second function declaration, and then is assigned 4.Here the function declaration is hoisted first, declaring and initializing variable a. Next, this variable is assigned 10. In other words: the assignment does not assign to outer variable a.",

In the first example, the whole function declaration is hoisted. In the second example only the var 'abc' is hoisted, its value (the function) will be undefined, and the function itself remains at the position that it is declared.To put it simply:To study more about this topic I strongly recommend you this\nlink",

Most of the code is in shared files, but branding-specific stuff is in a separate file, one for each branding.Some brandings require specific functions, and some do not. Sometimes I have to add new functions to do new branding-specific things. I am happy to change the shared coded, but I don't want to have to change all 160 sets of branding files.By using the variable syntax, I can declare the variable (a function pointer essentially) in the shared code and either assign a trivial stub function, or set to null.The one or two brandings that need a specific implementation of the function can then define their version of the function and assign this to the variable if they want, and the rest do nothing. I can test for a null function before I execute it in the shared code.From people's comments above, I gather it may be possible to redefine a static function too, but I think the variable solution is nice and clear.",

We declared a function defined it and executed it by calling it.What you should be knowing is that functions are actually objects in JavaScript; internally we have created an object for above function and given it a name called fn or the reference to the object is stored in fn. Functions are objects in JavaScript; an instance of function is actually an object instance.Function expression:JavaScript has first-class functions, that is, create a function and assign it to a variable just like you create a string or number and assign it to a variable. Here, the fn variable is assigned to a function. The reason for this concept is functions are objects in JavaScript; fn is pointing to the object instance of the above function. We have initialized a function and assigned it to a variable. It's not executing the function and assigning the result.Reference: JavaScript function declaration syntax: var fn = function() {} vs function fn() {}",

However, anonymous functions have some drawbacks:Readability: anonymous functions omit a name which could cause less readable code.Debugging: anonymous functions have no name in stack traces, which can make debugging more difficult.Self-Reference: what if the function needs to refer to itself, for recursion for example.Providing a name for your function expression quite effectively addresses all these drawbacks, and has no tangible downsides. The best practice is to always name your function expressions:For functions assigned to a variable, naming the function, in this case, is not very common and may cause confusion, in this case, the arrow function may be a better choice.",
                "In light of the \"named functions show up in stack traces\" argument, modern JavaScript engines are actually quite capable of representing anonymous functions.As of this writing, V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra and Nitro always refer to named functions by their names. They almost always refer to an anonymous function by its identifier if it has one.SpiderMonkey can figure out the name of an anonymous function returned from another function. The rest can't.If you really, really wanted your iterator and success callbacks to show up in the trace, you could name those too...But for the most part it's not worth stressing over.",
                "Both are different ways of defining a function. The difference is how the browser interprets and loads them into an execution context.The first case is of function expressions which loads only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. So if you do it like the following, you will get an error that the functionOne is not a function.The reason is that on the first line no value is assigned to functionOne, and hence it is undefined. We are trying to call it as a function, and hence we are getting an error.On the second line we are assigning the reference of an anonymous function to functionOne.The second case is of function declarations that loads before any code is executed.

                "It's a time zone change on December 31st in Shanghai.See this page for details of 1927 in Shanghai. Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So \"1927-12-31 23:54:08\" actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the later possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference.Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.EDIT: Stop press! History changes...The original question would no longer demonstrate quite the same behaviour, if rebuilt with version 2013a of TZDB. In 2013a, the result would be 358 seconds, with a transition time of 23:54:03 instead of 23:54:08.I only noticed this because I'm collecting questions like this in Noda Time, in the form of unit tests... The test has now been changed, but it just goes to show - not even historical data is safe.EDIT: History has changed again...In TZDB 2014f, the time of the change has moved to 1900-12-31, and it's now a mere 343 second change (so the time between t and t+1 is 344 seconds, if you see what I mean).EDIT: To answer a question around a transition at 1900... it looks like the Java timezone implementation treats all time zones as simply being in their standard time for any instant before the start of 1900 UTC:The code above produces no output on my Windows machine. So any time zone which has any offset other than its standard one at the start of 1900 will count that as a transition. TZDB itself has some data going back earlier than that, and doesn't rely on any idea of a \"fixed\" standard time (which is what getRawOffset assumes to be a valid concept) so other libraries needn't introduce this artificial transition.",

Use the local time only for display.This way you will be able to walk through any periods where hours or minutes happen twice.If you converted to UTC, add each second, and convert to local time for display. You would go through 11:54:08 p.m. LMT - 11:59:59 p.m. LMT and then 11:54:08 p.m. CST - 11:59:59 p.m. CST.",

There are two possible timezone offsets for 1927-12-31 23:54:08 at Asia/Shanghai, but only one offset for 1927-12-31 23:54:07. So, depending on which offset is used, there's either a one second difference or a 5 minutes and 53 seconds difference.This slight shift of offsets, instead of the usual one-hour daylight savings (summer time) we are used to, obscures the problem a bit.Note that the 2013a update of the timezone database moved this discontinuity a few seconds earlier, but the effect would still be observable.The new java.time package on Java 8 let use see this more clearly, and provide tools to handle it. Given:Then durationAtEarlierOffset will be one second, while durationAtLaterOffset will be five minutes and 53 seconds.Also, these two offsets are the same:But these two are different:You can see the same problem comparing 1927-12-31 23:59:59 with 1928-01-01 00:00:00, though, in this case, it is the earlier offset that produces the longer divergence, and it is the earlier date that has two possible offsets.Another way to approach this is to check whether there's a transition going on. We can do this like this:You can check whether the transition is an overlap where there's more than one valid offset for that date/time or a gap where that date/time is not valid for that zone id - by using the isOverlap() and isGap() methods on zot4.I hope this helps people handle this sort of issue once Java 8 becomes widely available, or to those using Java 7 who adopt the JSR 310 backport.",

So, that's why the difference between the two times is 343 seconds, not 1 second, as you would have expected.The time can also mess up in other places like the US. The US has Daylight Saving Time. When the Daylight Saving Time starts the time goes forward 1 hour. But after a while, the Daylight Saving Time ends, and it goes backward 1 hour back to the standard time zone. So sometimes when comparing times in the US the difference is about 3600 seconds not 1 second.But there is something different about these two-time changes. The latter changes continuously and the former was just a change. It didn't change back or change again by the same amount.It's better to use UTC unless if needed to use non-UTC time like in display.",

                "string is an alias in C# for System.String.\nSo technically, there is no difference.  It's like int vs. System.Int32.As far as guidelines, it's generally recommended to use string any time you're referring to an object.e.g.Likewise, I think it's generally recommended to use String if you need to refer specifically to the class.e.g.It appears that the guidance in this area may have changed, as StyleCop now enforces the use of the C# specific aliases.",
                "Just for the sake of completeness, here's a brain dump of related information...As others have noted, string is an alias for System.String. Assuming your code using String compiles to System.String (i.e. you haven't got a using directive for some other namespace with a different String type), they compile to the same code, so at execution time there is no difference whatsoever. This is just one of the aliases in C#. The complete list is:Apart from string and object, the aliases are all to value types. decimal is a value type, but not a primitive type in the CLR. The only primitive type which doesn't have an alias is System.IntPtr.In the spec, the value type aliases are known as \"simple types\". Literals can be used for constant values of every simple type; no other value types have literal forms available. (Compare this with VB, which allows DateTime literals, and has an alias for it too.)There is one circumstance in which you have to use the aliases: when explicitly specifying an enum's underlying type. For instance:That's just a matter of the way the spec defines enum declarations - the part after the colon has to be the integral-type production, which is one token of sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong, char... as opposed to a type production as used by variable declarations for example. It doesn't indicate any other difference.Finally, when it comes to which to use: personally I use the aliases everywhere for the implementation, but the CLR type for any APIs. It really doesn't matter too much which you use in terms of implementation - consistency among your team is nice, but no-one else is going to care. On the other hand, it's genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language-neutral way. A method called ReadInt32 is unambiguous, whereas a method called ReadInt requires interpretation. The caller could be using a language that defines an int alias for Int16, for example. The .NET framework designers have followed this pattern, good examples being in the BitConverter, BinaryReader and Convert classes.",

Depending on members of the current type, the current namespace and the applied using directives and their placement, String could be a value or a type distinct from global::System.String.I shall provide two examples where using directives will not help.First, when String is a value of the current type (or a local variable):The above will not compile because IEnumerable<> does not have a non-static member called Format, and no extension methods apply. In the above case, it may still be possible to use String in other contexts where a type is the only possibility syntactically. For example String local = \"Hi mum!\"; could be OK (depending on namespace and using directives).Worse: Saying String.Concat(someSequence) will likely (depending on usings) go to the Linq extension method Enumerable.Concat. It will not go to the static method string.Concat.Secondly, when String is another type, nested inside the current type:Neither statement in the Example method compiles. Here String is always a piano string, MyPiano.String. No member (static or not) Format exists on it (or is inherited from its base class). And the value \"Goodbye\" cannot be converted into it.",

                "I'd just like to add this to lfousts answer, from Ritchers book:The C# language specification states, \u201cAs a matter of style, use of the keyword is favored over\n  use of the complete system type name.\u201d I disagree with the language specification; I prefer\n  to use the FCL type names and completely avoid the primitive type names. In fact, I wish that\n  compilers didn\u2019t even offer the primitive type names and forced developers to use the FCL\n  type names instead. Here are my reasons:I\u2019ve seen a number of developers confused, not knowing whether to use string\n  or String in their code. Because in C# string (a keyword) maps exactly to\n  System.String (an FCL type), there is no difference and either can be used. Similarly,\n  I\u2019ve heard some developers say that int represents a 32-bit integer when the application\n  is running on a 32-bit OS and that it represents a 64-bit integer when the application\n  is running on a 64-bit OS. This statement is absolutely false: in C#, an int always maps\n  to System.Int32, and therefore it represents a 32-bit integer regardless of the OS the\n  code is running on. If programmers would use Int32 in their code, then this potential\n  confusion is also eliminated.In C#, long maps to System.Int64, but in a different programming language, long\n  could map to an Int16 or Int32. In fact, C++/CLI does treat long as an Int32.\n  Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code\u2019s\n  intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language.\n  In fact, most languages won\u2019t even treat long as a keyword and won\u2019t compile code\n  that uses it.The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For\n  example, the BinaryReader type offers methods such as ReadBoolean, ReadInt32,\n  ReadSingle, and so on, and the System.Convert type offers methods such as\n  ToBoolean, ToInt32, ToSingle, and so on. Although it\u2019s legal to write the following\n  code, the line with float feels very unnatural to me, and it\u2019s not obvious that the line is\n  correct:Many programmers that use C# exclusively tend to forget that other programming\n  languages can be used against the CLR, and because of this, C#-isms creep into the\n  class library code. For example, Microsoft\u2019s FCL is almost exclusively written in C# and\n  developers on the FCL team have now introduced methods into the library such as\n  Array\u2019s GetLongLength, which returns an Int64 value that is a long in C# but not\n  in other languages (like C++/CLI). Another example is System.Linq.Enumerable\u2019s\n  LongCount method.I didn't get his opinion before I read the complete paragraph.",

                "It's a matter of convention, really.  string just looks more like C/C++ style.  The general convention is to use whatever shortcuts your chosen language has provided (int/Int for Int32).  This goes for \"object\" and decimal as well.Theoretically this could help to port code into some future 64-bit standard in which \"int\" might mean Int64, but that's not the point, and I would expect any upgrade wizard to change any int references to Int32 anyway just to be safe.",
                "@JaredPar (a developer on the C# compiler and prolific SO user!) wrote a great blog post on this issue. I think it is worth sharing here. It is a nice perspective on our subject.[...]The keyword string has concrete meaning in C#. It is the type System.String which exists in the core runtime assembly. The runtime intrinsically understands this type and provides the capabilities developers expect for strings in .NET. Its presence is so critical to C# that if that type doesn\u2019t exist the compiler will exit before attempting to even parse a line of code. Hence string has a precise, unambiguous meaning in C# code.The identifier String though has no concrete meaning in C#. It is an identifier that goes through all the name lookup rules as Widget, Student, etc \u2026 It could bind to string or it could bind to a type in another assembly entirely whose purposes may be entirely different than string. Worse it could be defined in a way such that code like String s = \"hello\"; continued to compile.The actual meaning of String will always depend on name resolution.\nThat means it depends on all the source files in the project and all\nthe types defined in all the referenced assemblies. In short it\nrequires quite a bit of context to know what it means.True that in the vast majority of cases String and string will bind to\nthe same type. But using String still means developers are leaving\ntheir program up to interpretation in places where there is only one\ncorrect answer. When String does bind to the wrong type it can leave\ndevelopers debugging for hours, filing bugs on the compiler team, and\ngenerally wasting time that could\u2019ve been saved by using string.Another way to visualize the difference is with this sample:Many will argue that while this is information technically accurate using String is still fine because it\u2019s exceedingly rare that a codebase would define a type of this name. Or that when String is defined it\u2019s a sign of a bad codebase.[...]You\u2019ll see that String is defined for a number of completely valid purposes: reflection helpers, serialization libraries, lexers, protocols, etc \u2026 For any of these libraries String vs. string has real consequences depending on where the code is used.So remember when you see the String vs. string debate this is about semantics, not style. Choosing string gives crisp meaning to your codebase. Choosing String isn\u2019t wrong but it\u2019s leaving the door open for surprises in the future.Note: I copy/pasted most of the blog posts for archive reasons. I ignore some parts, so I recommend skipping and reading the blog post if you can.",

                "The delete operator is used to remove properties from objects.Note that, for arrays, this is not the same as removing an element. To remove an element from an array, use Array#splice or Array#pop. For example:Strictly speaking, it's impossible to truly delete anything in JavaScript. The delete operator neither deletes objects nor frees memory. Rather, it sets its operand to undefined and manipulates the parent object so that the member is gone.The object is not deleted. Only the reference is. Memory is only freed\nby the garbage collector when all references to an object are removed.Another important caveat is that the delete operator will not reorganize structures for you, which has results that can seem counterintuitive. Deleting an array index, for example, will leave a \"hole\" in it.This is because arrays are objects. So indices are the same as keys.Different built-in functions in JavaScript handle arrays with holes in them differently.for..in statements will skip the empty index completely.A naive for loop will yield undefined for the value at the index.Any method using Symbol.iterator will return undefined for the value at the index.forEach, map and reduce will simply skip the missing index, but will not remove itExample:So, the delete operator should not be used for the common use-case of removing elements from an array. Arrays have a dedicated methods for removing elements and reallocating memory: Array#splice() and Array#pop.Array#splice mutates the array, and returns any removed indices. deleteCount elements are removed from index start, and item1, item2... itemN are inserted into the array from index start. If deleteCount is omitted then elements from startIndex are removed to the end of the array.There is also a similarly named, but different, function on Array.prototype: Array#slice.Array#slice is non-destructive, and returns a new array containing the indicated indices from start to end. If end is left unspecified, it defaults to the end of the array. If end is positive, it specifies the zero-based non-inclusive index to stop at. If end is negative it, it specifies the index to stop at by counting back from the end of the array (eg. -1 will omit the final index). If end <= start, the result is an empty array.Array#pop removes the last element from an array, and returns that element. This operation changes the length of the array. The opposite operation is pushArray#shift is similar to pop, except it removes the first element. The opposite operation is unshift.",

The one is to remove it for whole the memory and the list of object keys or the other is just to remove it from your object. As it has been mentioned in some other answers, the delete keyword is the main part. Let's say you have your object like:If you do:the result would be:You can delete that specific key from your object keys like:Then your objects key using Object.keys(myJSONObject) would be:But the point is if you care about memory and you want to whole the object gets removed from the memory, it is recommended to set it to null before you delete the key:The other important point here is to be careful about your other references to the same object. For instance, if you create a variable like:Or add it as a new pointer to another object like:Then even if you remove it from your object myJSONObject, that specific object won't get deleted from the memory, since the regex variable and myOtherObject[\"regex\"] still have their values. Then how could we remove the object from the memory for sure?The answer would be to delete all the references you have in your code, pointed to that very object and also not use var statements to create new references to that object. This last point regarding var statements, is one of the most crucial issues that we are usually faced with, because using var statements would prevent the created object from getting removed.Which means in this case you won't be able to remove that object because you have created the regex variable via a var statement, and if you do:The result would be false, which means that your delete statement haven't been executed as you expected. But if you had not created that variable before, and you only had myOtherObject[\"regex\"] as your last existing reference, you could have done this just by removing it like:In other words, a JavaScript object is eligible to be killed as soon as there is no reference left in your code pointed to that object.Update:Thanks to @AgentME:Setting a property to null before deleting it doesn't accomplish\nanything (unless the object has been sealed by Object.seal and the\ndelete fails.

                "Before understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language.In most languages, classes are just pieces of code that describe how to produce an object. That's kinda true in Python too:But classes are more than that in Python. Classes are objects too.Yes, objects.As soon as you use the keyword class, Python executes it and creates\nan object. The instructioncreates in memory an object with the name ObjectCreator.This object (the class) is itself capable of creating objects (the instances),\nand this is why it's a class.But still, it's an object, and therefore:e.g.:Since classes are objects, you can create them on the fly, like any object.First, you can create a class in a function using class:But it's not so dynamic, since you still have to write the whole class yourself.Since classes are objects, they must be generated by something.When you use the class keyword, Python creates this object automatically. But as\nwith most things in Python, it gives you a way to do it manually.Remember the function type? The good old function that lets you know what\ntype an object is:Well, type has also a completely different ability: it can create classes on the fly. type can take the description of a class as parameters,\nand return a class.(I  know, it's silly that the same function can have two completely different uses according to the parameters you pass to it. It's an issue due to backward\ncompatibility in Python)type works this way:Where:e.g.:can be created manually this way:You'll notice that we use MyShinyClass as the name of the class\nand as the variable to hold the class reference. They can be different,\nbut there is no reason to complicate things.type accepts a dictionary to define the attributes of the class. So:Can be translated to:And used as a normal class:And of course, you can inherit from it, so:would be:Eventually, you'll want to add methods to your class. Just define a function\nwith the proper signature and assign it as an attribute.And you can add even more methods after you dynamically create the class, just like adding methods to a normally created class object.You see where we are going: in Python, classes are objects, and you can create a class on the fly, dynamically.This is what Python does when you use the keyword class, and it does so by using a metaclass.Metaclasses are the 'stuff' that creates classes.You define classes in order to create objects, right?But we learned that Python classes are objects.Well, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes' classes,\nyou can picture them this way:You've seen that type lets you do something like this:It's because the function type is in fact a metaclass. type is the\nmetaclass Python uses to create all classes behind the scenes.Now you wonder \"why the heck is it written in lowercase, and not Type?\"Well, I guess it's a matter of consistency with str, the class that creates\nstrings objects, and int the class that creates integer objects. type is\njust the class that creates class objects.You see that by checking the __class__ attribute.Everything, and I mean everything, is an object in Python. That includes integers,\nstrings, functions and classes. All of them are objects. And all of them have\nbeen created from a class:Now, what is the __class__ of any __class__ ?So, a metaclass is just the stuff that creates class objects.You can call it a 'class factory' if you wish.type is the built-in metaclass Python uses, but of course, you can create your\nown metaclass.In Python 2, you can add a __metaclass__ attribute when you write a class (see next section for the Python 3 syntax):If you do so, Python will use the metaclass to create the class Foo.Careful, it's tricky.You write class Foo(object) first, but the class object Foo is not created\nin memory yet.Python will look for __metaclass__ in the class definition. If it finds it,\nit will use it to create the object class Foo. If it doesn't, it will use\ntype to create the class.Read that several times.When you do:Python does the following:Is there a __metaclass__ attribute in Foo?If yes, create in-memory a class object (I said a class object, stay with me here), with the name Foo by using what is in __metaclass__.If Python can't find __metaclass__, it will look for a __metaclass__ at the MODULE level, and try to do the same (but only for classes that don't inherit anything, basically old-style classes).Then if it can't find any __metaclass__ at all, it will use the Bar's (the first parent) own metaclass (which might be the default type) to create the class object.Be careful here that the __metaclass__ attribute will not be inherited, the metaclass of the parent (Bar.__class__) will be. If Bar used a __metaclass__ attribute that created Bar with type() (and not type.__new__()), the subclasses will not inherit that behavior.Now the big question is, what can you put in __metaclass__?The answer is something that can create a class.And what can create a class? type, or anything that subclasses or uses it.The syntax to set the metaclass has been changed in Python 3:i.e. the __metaclass__ attribute is no longer used, in favor of a keyword argument in the list of base classes.The behavior of metaclasses however stays largely the same.One thing added to metaclasses in Python 3 is that you can also pass attributes as keyword-arguments into a metaclass, like so:Read the section below for how Python handles this.The main purpose of a metaclass is to change the class automatically,\nwhen it's created.You usually do this for APIs, where you want to create classes matching the\ncurrent context.Imagine a stupid example, where you decide that all classes in your module\nshould have their attributes written in uppercase. There are several ways to\ndo this, but one way is to set __metaclass__ at the module level.This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass,\nand we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.Luckily, __metaclass__ can actually be any callable, it doesn't need to be a\nformal class (I know, something with 'class' in its name doesn't need to be\na class, go figure... but it's helpful).So we will start with a simple example, by using a function.Let's check:Now, let's do exactly the same, but using a real class for a metaclass:Let's rewrite the above, but with shorter and more realistic variable names now that we know what they mean:You may have noticed the extra argument cls. There is\nnothing special about it: __new__ always receives the class it's defined in, as the first parameter. Just like you have self for ordinary methods which receive the instance as the first parameter, or the defining class for class methods.But this is not proper OOP. We are calling type directly and we aren't overriding or calling the parent's __new__. Let's do that instead:We can make it even cleaner by using super, which will ease inheritance (because yes, you can have metaclasses, inheriting from metaclasses, inheriting from type):Oh, and in Python 3 if you do this call with keyword arguments, like this:It translates to this in the metaclass to use it:That's it. There is really nothing more about metaclasses.The reason behind the complexity of the code using metaclasses is not because\nof metaclasses, it's because you usually use metaclasses to do twisted stuff\nrelying on introspection, manipulating inheritance, vars such as __dict__, etc.Indeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore\ncomplicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:Since __metaclass__ can accept any callable, why would you use a class\nsince it's obviously more complicated?There are several reasons to do so:Now the big question. Why would you use some obscure error-prone feature?Well, usually you don't:Metaclasses are deeper magic that\n99% of users should never worry about it.\nIf you wonder whether you need them,\nyou don't (the people who actually\nneed them know with certainty that\nthey need them, and don't need an\nexplanation about why).Python Guru Tim PetersThe main use case for a metaclass is creating an API. A typical example of this is the Django ORM. It allows you to define something like this:But if you do this:It won't return an IntegerField object. It will return an int, and can even take it directly from the database.This is possible because models.Model defines __metaclass__ and\nit uses some magic that will turn the Person you just defined with simple statements\ninto a complex hook to a database field.Django makes something complex look simple by exposing a simple API\nand using metaclasses, recreating code from this API to do the real job\nbehind the scenes.First, you know that classes are objects that can create instances.Well, in fact, classes are themselves instances. Of metaclasses.Everything is an object in Python, and they are all either instance of classes\nor instances of metaclasses.Except for type.type is actually its own metaclass. This is not something you could\nreproduce in pure Python, and is done by cheating a little bit at the implementation\nlevel.Secondly, metaclasses are complicated. You may not want to use them for\nvery simple class alterations. You can change classes by using two different techniques:99% of the time you need class alteration, you are better off using these.But 98% of the time, you don't need class alteration at all.",
                "A metaclass is the class of a class. A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the better approach is to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. When you create an object by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry or replace the class with something else entirely.When the class statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it.However, metaclasses actually define the type of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like __add__, __iter__ and __getattr__, to implement or change how the class behaves.Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:",
                "Note, this answer is for Python 2.x as it was written in 2008, metaclasses are slightly different in 3.x.Metaclasses are the secret sauce that make 'class' work. The default metaclass for a new style object is called 'type'.Metaclasses take 3 args. 'name', 'bases' and 'dict'Here is where the secret starts. Look for where name, bases and the dict come from in this example class definition.Lets define a metaclass that will demonstrate how 'class:' calls it.And now, an example that actually means something, this will automatically make the variables in the list \"attributes\" set on the class, and set to None.Note that the magic behaviour that Initialised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclass of Initialised.Here is an even more concrete example, showing how you can subclass 'type' to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created. This is quite tricky:",
                "Others have explained how metaclasses work and how they fit into the Python type system. Here's an example of what they can be used for. In a testing framework I wrote, I wanted to keep track of the order in which classes were defined, so that I could later instantiate them in this order. I found it easiest to do this using a metaclass.Anything that's a subclass of MyType then gets a class attribute _order that records the order in which the classes were defined.",
                "One use for metaclasses is adding new properties and methods to an instance automatically.For example, if you look at Django models, their definition looks a bit confusing. It looks as if you are only defining class properties:However, at runtime the Person objects are filled with all sorts of useful methods. See the source for some amazing metaclassery.",
                "I think the ONLamp introduction to metaclass programming is well written and gives a really good introduction to the topic despite being several years old already.http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html (archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20080206005253/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html)In short: A class is a blueprint for the creation of an instance, a metaclass is a blueprint for the creation of a class. It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior.I've never written one myself, but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework. The model classes use a metaclass approach to enable a declarative style of writing new models or form classes. While the metaclass is creating the class, all members get the possibility to customize the class itself.The thing that's left to say is: If you don't know what metaclasses are, the probability that you will not need them is 99%.",
                "TLDR: A metaclass instantiates and defines behavior for a class just like a class instantiates and defines behavior for an instance.Pseudocode:The above should look familiar. Well, where does Class come from? It's an instance of a metaclass (also pseudocode):In real code, we can pass the default metaclass, type, everything we need to instantiate a class and we get a class:A class is to an instance as a metaclass is to a class.When we instantiate an object, we get an instance:Likewise, when we define a class explicitly with the default metaclass, type, we instantiate it:Put another way, a class is an instance of a metaclass:Put a third way, a metaclass is a class's class.When you write a class definition and Python executes it, it uses a metaclass to instantiate the class object (which will, in turn, be used to instantiate instances of that class).Just as we can use class definitions to change how custom object instances behave, we can use a metaclass class definition to change the way a class object behaves.What can they be used for? From the docs:The potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have been explored include logging, interface checking, automatic delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and automatic resource locking/synchronization.Nevertheless, it is usually encouraged for users to avoid using metaclasses unless absolutely necessary.When you write a class definition, for example, like this,You instantiate a class object.It is the same as functionally calling type with the appropriate arguments and assigning the result to a variable of that name:Note, some things automatically get added to the __dict__, i.e., the namespace:The metaclass of the object we created, in both cases, is type.(A side-note on the contents of the class __dict__: __module__ is there because classes must know where they are defined, and  __dict__ and __weakref__ are there because we don't define __slots__ - if we define __slots__ we'll save a bit of space in the instances, as we can disallow __dict__ and __weakref__ by excluding them. For example:... but I digress.)Here's the default __repr__ of classes:One of the most valuable things we can do by default in writing a Python object is to provide it with a good __repr__. When we call help(repr) we learn that there's a good test for a __repr__ that also requires a test for equality - obj == eval(repr(obj)). The following simple implementation of __repr__ and __eq__ for class instances of our type class provides us with a demonstration that may improve on the default __repr__ of classes:So now when we create an object with this metaclass, the __repr__ echoed on the command line provides a much less ugly sight than the default:With a nice __repr__ defined for the class instance, we have a stronger ability to debug our code. However, much further checking with eval(repr(Class)) is unlikely (as functions would be rather impossible to eval from their default __repr__'s).If, for example, we want to know in what order a class's methods are created in, we could provide an ordered dict as the namespace of the class. We would do this with __prepare__ which returns the namespace dict for the class if it is implemented in Python 3:And usage:And now we have a record of the order in which these methods (and other class attributes) were created:Note, this example was adapted from the documentation - the new enum in the standard library does this.So what we did was instantiate a metaclass by creating a class. We can also treat the metaclass as we would any other class. It has a method resolution order:And it has approximately the correct repr (which we can no longer eval unless we can find a way to represent our functions.):",
                "Python 3 updateThere are (at this point) two key methods in a metaclass:__prepare__ lets you supply a custom mapping (such as an OrderedDict) to be used as the namespace while the class is being created.  You must return an instance of whatever namespace you choose.  If you don't implement __prepare__ a normal dict is used.__new__ is responsible for the actual creation/modification of the final class.A bare-bones, do-nothing-extra metaclass would like:A simple example:Say you want some simple validation code to run on your attributes -- like it must always be an int or a str.  Without a metaclass, your class would look something like:As you can see, you have to repeat the name of the attribute twice.  This makes typos possible along with irritating bugs.A simple metaclass can address that problem:This is what the metaclass would look like (not using __prepare__ since it is not needed):A sample run of:produces:Note:  This example is simple enough it could have also been accomplished with a class decorator, but presumably an actual metaclass would be doing much more.The 'ValidateType' class for reference:",
                "If you've done Python programming for more than a few months you'll eventually stumble upon code that looks like this:The latter is possible when you implement the __call__() magic method on the class.The __call__() method is invoked when an instance of a class is used as a callable. But as we've seen from previous answers a class itself is an instance of a metaclass, so when we use the class as a callable (i.e. when we create an instance of it) we're actually calling its metaclass' __call__() method. At this point most Python programmers are a bit confused because they've been told that when creating an instance like this instance = SomeClass() you're calling its __init__() method. Some who've dug a bit deeper know that before __init__() there's __new__(). Well, today another layer of truth is being revealed, before __new__() there's the metaclass' __call__().Let's study the method call chain from specifically the perspective of creating an instance of a class.This is a metaclass that logs exactly the moment before an instance is created and the moment it's about to return it.This is a class that uses that metaclassAnd now let's create an instance of Class_1Observe that the code above doesn't actually do anything more than logging the tasks. Each method delegates the actual work to its parent's implementation, thus keeping the default behavior. Since type is Meta_1's parent class (type being the default parent metaclass) and considering the ordering sequence of the output above, we now have a clue as to what would be the pseudo implementation of type.__call__():We can see that the metaclass' __call__() method is the one that's called first. It then delegates creation of the instance to the class's __new__() method and initialization to the instance's __init__(). It's also the one that ultimately returns the instance.From the above it stems that the metaclass' __call__() is also given the opportunity to decide whether or not a call to Class_1.__new__() or Class_1.__init__() will eventually be made. Over the course of its execution it could actually return an object that hasn't been touched by either of these methods. Take for example this approach to the singleton pattern:Let's observe what happens when repeatedly trying to create an object of type Class_2",

They are present in popular libraries, such as Django and WTForms.As DavidW points out in the comments beneath this answer, these are library-specific features and are not to be confused with the advanced, unrelated Python language feature with a similar name.Rather, these are namespaces within classes' dicts. They are constructed using inner classes for sake of readability.In this example special field, abstract is visibly separate from fields of Author model.Another example is from the documentation for WTForms:This syntax does not get special treatment in the python programming language.

This metaclass is a special type of class that creates other class's objects. Hence, metaclass is responsible for making new classes. This allows the programmer to customize the way classes are generated.To create a metaclass, overriding of new() and init() methods is usually done. new() can be overridden to change the way objects are created, while init() can be overridden to change the way of initializing the object. Metaclass can be created by a number of ways. One of the ways is to use type() function. type() function, when called with 3 parameters, creates a metaclass.

Using this new module, you can check whether a file exists like this:You can (and usually should) still use a try/except block when opening files:The pathlib module has lots of cool stuff in it: convenient globbing, checking file's owner, easier path joining, etc.  It's worth checking out.

Note that .exists is not quite right, because directories are not files (except in the unix sense that everything is a file).So we need to use is_file:Here's the help on is_file:So let's get a file that we know is a file:By default, NamedTemporaryFile deletes the file when closed (and will automatically close when no more references exist to it).If you dig into the implementation, though, you'll see that is_file uses try:We like try because it avoids race conditions. With try, you simply attempt to read your file, expecting it to be there, and if not, you catch the exception and perform whatever fallback behavior makes sense.If you want to check that a file exists before you attempt to read it, and you might be deleting it and then you might be using multiple threads or processes, or another program knows about that file and could delete it - you risk the chance of a race condition if you check it exists, because you are then racing to open it before its condition (its existence) changes.Race conditions are very hard to debug because there's a very small window in which they can cause your program to fail.But if this is your motivation, you can get the value of a try statement by using the suppress context manager.Python 3.4 gives us the suppress context manager (previously the ignore context manager), which does semantically exactly the same thing in fewer lines, while also (at least superficially) meeting the original ask to avoid a try statement:Usage:For earlier Pythons, you could roll your own suppress, but without a try will be more verbose than with. I do believe this actually is the only answer that doesn't use try at any level in the Python that can be applied to prior to Python 3.4 because it uses a context manager instead:Perhaps easier with a try:isfilefrom the docs:os.path.isfile(path)Return True if path is an existing regular file. This follows symbolic\n  links, so both islink() and isfile() can be true for the same path.But if you examine the source of this function, you'll see it actually does use a try statement:All it's doing is using the given path to see if it can get stats on it,  catching OSError and then checking if it's a file if it didn't raise the exception.If you intend to do something with the file, I would suggest directly attempting it with a try-except to avoid a race condition:os.accessAvailable for Unix and Windows is os.access, but to use you must pass flags, and it does not differentiate between files and directories. This is more used to test if the real invoking user has access in an elevated privilege environment:It also suffers from the same race condition problems as isfile. From the docs:Note:\n  Using access() to check if a user is authorized to e.g. open a file\n  before actually doing so using open() creates a security hole, because\n  the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and\n  opening the file to manipulate it. It\u2019s preferable to use EAFP\n  techniques. For example:is better written as:Avoid using os.access. It is a low level function that has more opportunities for user error than the higher level objects and functions discussed above.Another answer says this about os.access:Personally, I prefer this one because under the hood, it calls native APIs (via \"${PYTHON_SRC_DIR}/Modules/posixmodule.c\"), but it also opens a gate for possible user errors, and it's not as Pythonic as other variants:This answer says it prefers a non-Pythonic, error-prone method, with no justification. It seems to encourage users to use low-level APIs without understanding them.It also creates a context manager which, by unconditionally returning True, allows all Exceptions (including KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit!) to pass silently, which is a good way to hide bugs.This seems to encourage users to adopt poor practices.",

Of course, you can always\nuse a try except` statement like so (thanks to hsandt\nfor making me think):Use os.path.exists(path):This will check the existence of what you specify. However, it checks for files and directories so beware about how you use it.Use os.access(path, mode):This will check whether you have access to the file. It will check for permissions. Based on the os.py documentation, typing in os.F_OK, it will check the existence of the path. However, using this will create a security hole, as someone can attack your file using the time between checking the permissions and opening the file. You should instead go directly to opening the file instead of checking its permissions. (EAFP vs LBYP). If you're not going to open the file afterwards, and only checking its existence, then you can use this.Anyway, here:I should also mention that there are two ways that you will not be able to verify the existence of a file.

The classically Pythonic way, available in Python 2 and Python 3.0-3.4, is to do this as a two-step process:In both approaches, y will come second and its values will replace x's values, thus b will point to 3 in our final result.If you are not yet on Python 3.5 or need to write backward-compatible code, and you want this in a single expression, the most performant while the correct approach is to put it in a function:and then you have a single expression:You can also make a function to merge an arbitrary number of dictionaries, from zero to a very large number:This function will work in Python 2 and 3 for all dictionaries. e.g. given dictionaries a to g:and key-value pairs in g will take precedence over dictionaries a to f, and so on.Don't use what you see in the formerly accepted answer:In Python 2, you create two lists in memory for each dict, create a third list in memory with length equal to the length of the first two put together, and then discard all three lists to create the dict. In Python 3, this will fail because you're adding two dict_items objects together, not two lists -and you would have to explicitly create them as lists, e.g. z = dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items())). This is a waste of resources and computation power.Similarly, taking the union of items() in Python 3 (viewitems() in Python 2.7) will also fail when values are unhashable objects (like lists, for example). Even if your values are hashable, since sets are semantically unordered, the behavior is undefined in regards to precedence. So don't do this:This example demonstrates what happens when values are unhashable:Here's an example where y should have precedence, but instead the value from x is retained due to the arbitrary order of sets:Another hack you should not use:This uses the dict constructor and is very fast and memory-efficient (even slightly more so than our two-step process) but unless you know precisely what is happening here (that is, the second dict is being passed as keyword arguments to the dict constructor), it's difficult to read, it's not the intended usage, and so it is not Pythonic.Here's an example of the usage being remediated in django.Dictionaries are intended to take hashable keys (e.g. frozensets or tuples), but this method fails in Python 3 when keys are not strings.From the mailing list, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, wrote:I am fine with\ndeclaring dict({}, **{1:3}) illegal, since after all it is abuse of\nthe ** mechanism.andApparently dict(x, **y) is going around as \"cool hack\" for \"call\nx.update(y) and return x\". Personally, I find it more despicable than\ncool.It is my understanding (as well as the understanding of the creator of the language) that the intended usage for dict(**y) is for creating dictionaries for readability purposes, e.g.:instead ofDespite what Guido says, dict(x, **y) is in line with the dict specification, which btw. works for both Python 2 and 3. The fact that this only works for string keys is a direct consequence of how keyword parameters work and not a short-coming of dict. Nor is using the ** operator in this place an abuse of the mechanism, in fact, ** was designed precisely to pass dictionaries as keywords.Again, it doesn't work for 3 when keys are not strings. The implicit calling contract is that namespaces take ordinary dictionaries, while users must only pass keyword arguments that are strings. All other callables enforced it. dict broke this consistency in Python 2:This inconsistency was bad given other implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython). Thus it was fixed in Python 3, as this usage could be a breaking change.I submit to you that it is malicious incompetence to intentionally write code that only works in one version of a language or that only works given certain arbitrary constraints.More comments:dict(x.items() + y.items()) is still the most readable solution for Python 2. Readability counts.My response: merge_two_dicts(x, y) actually seems much clearer to me, if we're actually concerned about readability. And it is not forward compatible, as Python 2 is increasingly deprecated.{**x, **y} does not seem to handle nested dictionaries. the contents of nested keys are simply overwritten, not merged [...] I ended up being burnt by these answers that do not merge recursively and I was surprised no one mentioned it. In my interpretation of the word \"merging\" these answers describe \"updating one dict with another\", and not merging.Yes. I must refer you back to the question, which is asking for a shallow merge of two dictionaries, with the first's values being overwritten by the second's - in a single expression.Assuming two dictionaries of dictionaries, one might recursively merge them in a single function, but you should be careful not to modify the dictionaries from either source, and the surest way to avoid that is to make a copy when assigning values. As keys must be hashable and are usually therefore immutable, it is pointless to copy them:Usage:Coming up with contingencies for other value types is far beyond the scope of this question, so I will point you at my answer to the canonical question on a \"Dictionaries of dictionaries merge\".These approaches are less performant, but they will provide correct behavior.\nThey will be much less performant than copy and update or the new unpacking because they iterate through each key-value pair at a higher level of abstraction, but they do respect the order of precedence (latter dictionaries have precedence)You can also chain the dictionaries manually inside a dict comprehension:or in Python 2.6 (and perhaps as early as 2.4 when generator expressions were introduced):itertools.chain will chain the iterators over the key-value pairs in the correct order:I'm only going to do the performance analysis of the usages known to behave correctly.

                "Another, more concise, option:Note: this has become a popular answer, but it is important to point out that if y has any non-string keys, the fact that this works at all is an abuse of a CPython implementation detail, and it does not work in Python 3, or in PyPy, IronPython, or Jython. Also, Guido is not a fan. So I can't recommend this technique for forward-compatible or cross-implementation portable code, which really means it should be avoided entirely.",
                "This probably won't be a popular answer, but you almost certainly do not want to do this.  If you want a copy that's a merge, then use copy (or deepcopy, depending on what you want) and then update.  The two lines of code are much more readable - more Pythonic - than the single line creation with .items() + .items().  Explicit is better than implicit.In addition, when you use .items() (pre Python 3.0), you're creating a new list that contains the items from the dict.  If your dictionaries are large, then that is quite a lot of overhead (two large lists that will be thrown away as soon as the merged dict is created).  update() can work more efficiently, because it can run through the second dict item-by-item.In terms of time:IMO the tiny slowdown between the first two is worth it for the readability.  In addition, keyword arguments for dictionary creation was only added in Python 2.3, whereas copy() and update() will work in older versions.",
                "In a follow-up answer, you asked about the relative performance of these two alternatives:On my machine, at least (a fairly ordinary x86_64 running Python 2.5.2), alternative z2 is not only shorter and simpler but also significantly faster.  You can verify this for yourself using the timeit module that comes with Python.Example 1: identical dictionaries mapping 20 consecutive integers to themselves:z2 wins by a factor of 3.5 or so.  Different dictionaries seem to yield quite different results, but z2 always seems to come out ahead.  (If you get inconsistent results for the same test, try passing in -r with a number larger than the default 3.)Example 2: non-overlapping dictionaries mapping 252 short strings to integers and vice versa:z2 wins by about a factor of 10.  That's a pretty big win in my book!After comparing those two, I wondered if z1's poor performance could be attributed to the overhead of constructing the two item lists, which in turn led me to wonder if this variation might work better:A few quick tests, e.g.lead me to conclude that z3 is somewhat faster than z1, but not nearly as fast as z2.  Definitely not worth all the extra typing.This discussion is still missing something important, which is a performance comparison of these alternatives with the \"obvious\" way of merging two lists: using the update method.  To try to keep things on an equal footing with the expressions, none of which modify x or y, I'm going to make a copy of x instead of modifying it in-place, as follows:A typical result:In other words, z0 and z2 seem to have essentially identical performance.  Do you think this might be a coincidence?  I don't....In fact, I'd go so far as to claim that it's impossible for pure Python code to do any better than this.  And if you can do significantly better in a C extension module, I imagine the Python folks might well be interested in incorporating your code (or a variation on your approach) into the Python core.  Python uses dict in lots of places; optimizing its operations is a big deal.You could also write this asas Tony does, but (not surprisingly) the difference in notation turns out not to have any measurable effect on performance.

This amounts to using lambda as a let expression, which is a common technique in functional languages, but is maybe unpythonic.Although it's not that different from the following use of the new walrus operator (Python 3.8+ only),especially if you use a default argument:If you do want a copy, PEP 584 style x | y is the most Pythonic on 3.9+. If you must support older versions, PEP 448 style {**x, **y} is easiest for 3.5+. But if that's not available in your (even older) Python version, the let expression pattern works here too.(That is, of course, nearly equivalent to (z := x.copy()).update(y) or z, but if your Python version is new enough for that, then the PEP 448 style will be available.)",

                "\u2192 For a more general explanation of asynchronous behaviour with different examples, see Why is my variable unaltered after I modify it inside of a function? - Asynchronous code reference\u2192 If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.The A in Ajax stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.The same is happening when you make a function call containing \"normal\" code:Even though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does \"Ajax\"), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.Why is it bad do you ask?JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a \"synchronous style\". The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.async/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await \"unwraps\" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.Important: You can only use await inside an async function or in a JavaScript module. Top-level await is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context if not using a module.You can read more about async and await on MDN.Here is an example that elaborates the delay function findItem() above:Current browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So thisbecomesHere we defined the function \"inline\" but you can pass any function reference:foo itself is defined as follows:callback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.\nDifficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., bluebird).Promises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its \"listeners\" who want to access this value.The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.Here is an example of using a promise:function delay() {\n  // `delay` returns a promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\ndelay()\n  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise\n    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved\n  })\n  .catch(function(v) {\n    // Or do something else if it is rejected\n    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).\n  });\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:function ajax(url) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhr.onload = function() {\n      resolve(this.responseText);\n    };\n    xhr.onerror = reject;\n    xhr.open('GET', url);\n    xhr.send();\n  });\n}\n\najax(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\n  .then(function(result) {\n    console.log(result); // Code depending on result\n  })\n  .catch(function() {\n    // An error occurred\n  });\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.More information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises.Deferred objects are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a \"deferred object\" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:This code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.But the fix is easy:As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.If you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8.\nYou can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).Heads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).",
                "Your code should be something along the lines of this:Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, but I've decided to provide an alternative for people who aren't.(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below)This is a short summary of \"Explanation of the problem\" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.The A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.Here is a simple analogy:(Fiddle)The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.This is called CPS. Basically, we're passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).Usage would be:Which should alert \"5\" to the screen. (Fiddle).There are basically two ways how to solve this:As for synchronous AJAX, don't do it! Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...If you have to do it, you can pass a flag. Here is how:Let your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.So:Becomes:Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly(fiddle)We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.If you're still having a hard time understanding this, read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.",
                "XMLHttpRequest 2 (first of all, read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum and Felix Kling)If you don't use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:As you can see:There are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):The simplest:Or if for some reason you bind() the callback to a class:Example:Or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):Nothing easier.Now some people will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That's wrong.Check out XMLHttpRequest advanced features.It supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.Using the XMLHttpRequest variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.Now if you want something more complex using POST and FormData you can easily extend this function:Again ... it's a very short function, but it does GET and POST.Examples of usage:Or pass a full form element (document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]):Or set some custom values:As you can see, I didn't implement sync... it's a bad thing.Having said that ... why don't we do it the easy way?As mentioned in the comment, the use of error && synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?Error handlerIn the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.But to really get out an error, the only way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.Error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as the method it won't throw an error.Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.In the first case the error is inside the displayAjax() under this.statusText as Method not Allowed.In the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.Cross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.In the error response, there aren't any error codes.There is only the this.type which is set to error.Why add an error handler if you totally don't have any control over errors?\nMost of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function displayAjax().So: There isn't any need for error checks if you're able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)PS: As the first test I wrote x('x', displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called 'x.xml'. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT. I LOL'dRead a file synchronousDon't do that.If you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big .txt file synchronous.Now you can doThere is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)Another point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.The functions above are for basic use.If you want to extend the function...Yes, you can.I'm using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...But you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...But in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...But the question here is how to return an Ajax response... (I added an easy way.)",
                "This means AngularJS, jQuery (with deferred), native XHR's replacement (fetch), Ember.js, Backbone.js's save or any Node.js library that returns promises.Your code should be something along the lines of this:Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery with callbacks for Ajax. I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend.The JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with Node.js/io.js is asynchronous and reactive.Whenever you call a method that returns a promise, the then handlers are always executed asynchronously - that is, after the code below them that is not in a .then handler.This means when you're returning data the then handler you've defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time.Here is a simple analogy for the issue:function getFive(){\n        var data;\n        setTimeout(function(){ // Set a timer for one second in the future\n           data = 5; // After a second, do this\n        }, 1000);\n        return data;\n    }\n    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5The value of data is undefined since the data = 5 part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second, but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.Since the operation did not happen yet (Ajax, server call, I/O, and timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively, telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.A Promise is a value over time. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:A promise can only change states once after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach then handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. then handlers allow chaining of calls. Promises are created by using APIs that return them. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement fetch or jQuery's $.get return promises.When we call .then on a promise and return something from it - we get a promise for the processed value. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the Promise constructor for creating a delay function:Now, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use then to make it count:function delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds\n  // Returns a new promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,\n      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\n    }, ms);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction getFive(){\n  // We're RETURNING the promise. Remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value\n  return delay(100).then(function(){ // When the promise is ready,\n      return 5; // return the value 5. Promises are all about return values\n  })\n}\n// We _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, and we can't access the plain value\ngetFive().then(function(five){\n   document.body.innerHTML = five;\n});Basically, instead of returning a value which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a wrapper for a value that we can unwrap with then. It's like a box you can open with then.This stands the same for your original API call, you can:So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.ES6 introduces generators which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:Is a function that returns an iterator over the sequence 1,2,3,3,3,3,.... which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of future values - that is: promises.This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick let\u2019s us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several \"runners\" that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's Promise.coroutine here, but there are other wrappers like co or Q.async.This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:In ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can await promise. This is just \"sugar\" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the async and await keywords. Making the above example:It still returns a promise just the same :)",
                "You are using Ajax incorrectly. The idea is not to have it return anything, but instead hand off the data to something called a callback function, which handles the data.That is:Returning anything in the submit handler will not do anything.

                "Most of the answers here give useful suggestions for when you have a single async operation, but sometimes, this comes up when you need to do an asynchronous operation for each entry in an array or other list-like structure. The temptation is to do this:Example:// WRONG\nvar theArray = [1, 2, 3];\nvar results = [];\ntheArray.forEach(function(entry) {\n    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {\n        results.push(result);\n    });\n});\nconsole.log(\"Results:\", results); // E.g., using them, returning them, etc.\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value, callback) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n        callback(value * 2);\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }The reason that doesn't work is that the callbacks from doSomethingAsync haven't run yet by the time you're trying to use the results.So, if you have an array (or list of some kind) and want to do async operations for each entry, you have two options: Do the operations in parallel (overlapping), or in series (one after another in sequence).You can start all of them and keep track of how many callbacks you're expecting, and then use the results when you've gotten that many callbacks:Example:var theArray = [1, 2, 3];\nvar results = [];\nvar expecting = theArray.length;\ntheArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {\n    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {\n        results[index] = result;\n        if (--expecting === 0) {\n            // Done!\n            console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results)); // E.g., using the results\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value, callback) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n        callback(value * 2);\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }(We could do away with expecting and just use results.length === theArray.length, but that leaves us open to the possibility that theArray is changed while the calls are outstanding...)Notice how we use the index from forEach to save the result in results in the same position as the entry it relates to, even if the results arrive out of order (since async calls don't necessarily complete in the order in which they were started).But what if you need to return those results from a function? As the other answers have pointed out, you can't; you have to have your function accept and call a callback (or return a Promise). Here's a callback version:Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {\n    var results = [];\n    var expecting = theArray.length;\n    theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {\n        doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {\n            results[index] = result;\n            if (--expecting === 0) {\n                // Done!\n                callback(results);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3], function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value, callback) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n        callback(value * 2);\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }Or here's a version returning a Promise instead:Of course, if doSomethingAsync passed us errors, we'd use reject to reject the promise when we got an error.)Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n        var results = [];\n        var expecting = theArray.length;\n        theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {\n            doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {\n                results[index] = result;\n                if (--expecting === 0) {\n                    // Done!\n                    resolve(results);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3]).then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value, callback) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n        callback(value * 2);\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }(Or alternately, you could make a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that returns a promise, and then do the below...)If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, you can use Promise.all:If you know that doSomethingAsync will ignore a second and third argument, you can just pass it directly to map (map calls its callback with three arguments, but most people only use the first most of the time):Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray) {\n    return Promise.all(theArray.map(doSomethingAsync));\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3]).then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n            resolve(value * 2);\n        }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n    });\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }Note that Promise.all resolves its promise with an array of the results of all of the promises you give it when they are all resolved, or rejects its promise when the first of the promises you give it rejects.Suppose you don't want the operations to be in parallel? If you want to run them one after another, you need to wait for each operation to complete before you start the next. Here's an example of a function that does that and calls a callback with the result:(Since we're doing the work in series, we can just use results.push(result) since we know we won't get results out of order. In the above we could have used results[index] = result;, but in some of the following examples we don't have an index to use.)Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {\n    var results = [];\n    doOne(0);\n    function doOne(index) {\n        if (index < theArray.length) {\n            doSomethingAsync(theArray[index], function(result) {\n                results.push(result);\n                doOne(index + 1);\n            });\n        } else {\n            // Done!\n            callback(results);\n        }\n    }\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3], function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value, callback) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n        callback(value * 2);\n    }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }(Or, again, build a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that gives you a promise and do the below...)If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, if you can use ES2017+ syntax (perhaps with a transpiler like Babel), you can use an async function with for-of and await:Example:async function doSomethingWith(theArray) {\n    const results = [];\n    for (const entry of theArray) {\n        results.push(await doSomethingAsync(entry));\n    }\n    return results;\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3]).then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n            resolve(value * 2);\n        }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n    });\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }If you can't use ES2017+ syntax (yet), you can use a variation on the \"Promise reduce\" pattern (this is more complex than the usual Promise reduce because we're not passing the result from one into the next, but instead gathering up their results in an array):Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray) {\n    return theArray.reduce(function(p, entry) {\n        return p.then(function(results) {\n            return doSomethingAsync(entry).then(function(result) {\n                results.push(result);\n                return results;\n            });\n        });\n    }, Promise.resolve([]));\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3]).then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n            resolve(value * 2);\n        }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n    });\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }...which is less cumbersome with ES2015+ arrow functions:Example:function doSomethingWith(theArray) {\n    return theArray.reduce((p, entry) => p.then(results => doSomethingAsync(entry).then(result => {\n        results.push(result);\n        return results;\n    })), Promise.resolve([]));\n}\ndoSomethingWith([1, 2, 3]).then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"Results:\", JSON.stringify(results));\n});\n\nfunction doSomethingAsync(value) {\n    console.log(\"Starting async operation for \" + value);\n    return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            console.log(\"Completing async operation for \" + value);\n            resolve(value * 2);\n        }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 200));\n    });\n}\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; }",
                "Have a look at this example:As you can see getJoke is returning a resolved promise (it is resolved when returning res.data.value).

For example, in promises we have some function like success() or then() which will be executed when your data is ready for you. The same with callback or the subscribe function on an observable.For example, in your case which you are using jQuery, you can do something like this:For more information, study promises and observables which are newer ways to do this async stuff.",
                "It's a very common issue we face while struggling with the 'mysteries' of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.Let's start with a simple JavaScript function:That's a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is 'finished with its job' before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.Now let's add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not 'finished' in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:So there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it's actually pretty logical if you look at the code.The function foo(), upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is undefined), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return 'wohoo'. But as you can see, the value that's assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just undefined.So, how do we tackle this issue?Let's ask our function for a promise.\nPromise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let's see it in action for our little problem above:Thus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.Apart from using then/catch to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to recognize an asynchronous function and then wait for the promises to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It's still just the promises under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:",
                "Another approach to return a value from an asynchronous function, is to pass in an object that will store the result from the asynchronous function.Here is an example of the same:I am using the result object to store the value during the asynchronous operation. This allows the result be available even after the asynchronous job.I use this approach a lot. I would be interested to know how well this approach works where wiring the result back through consecutive modules is involved.",
                "While promises and callbacks work fine in many situations, it is a pain in the rear to express something like:You'd end up going through async1; check if name is undefined or not and call the callback accordingly.While it is okay in small examples it gets annoying when you have a lot of similar cases and error handling involved.Fibers helps in solving the issue.You can checkout the project here.",

It will define a simple request object that uses the window XMLHttpRequest object to make calls. It will define a simple function to wait for a bunch of promises to be completed.Context. The example is querying the Spotify Web API endpoint in order to search for playlist objects for a given set of query strings:For each item, a new Promise will fire a block - ExecutionBlock, parse the result, schedule a new set of promises based on the result array, that is a list of Spotify user objects and execute the new HTTP call within the ExecutionProfileBlock asynchronously.You can then see a nested Promise structure, that lets you spawn multiple and completely asynchronous nested HTTP calls, and join the results from each subset of calls through Promise.all.NOTE\nRecent Spotify search APIs will require an access token to be specified in the request headers:So, you to run the following example you need to put your access token in the request headers:var spotifyAccessToken = \"YourSpotifyAccessToken\";\r\nvar console = {\r\n    log: function(s) {\r\n        document.getElementById(\"console\").innerHTML += s + \"<br/>\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Simple XMLHttpRequest\r\n// based on https://davidwalsh.name/xmlhttprequest\r\nSimpleRequest = {\r\n    call: function(what, response) {\r\n        var request;\r\n        if (window.XMLHttpRequest) { // Mozilla, Safari, ...\r\n            request = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n        } else if (window.ActiveXObject) { // Internet Explorer\r\n            try {\r\n                request = new ActiveXObject('Msxml2.XMLHTTP');\r\n            }\r\n            catch (e) {\r\n                try {\r\n                  request = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\r\n                } catch (e) {}\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // State changes\r\n        request.onreadystatechange = function() {\r\n            if (request.readyState === 4) { // Done\r\n                if (request.status === 200) { // Complete\r\n                    response(request.responseText)\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                    response();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        request.open('GET', what, true);\r\n        request.setRequestHeader(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \" + spotifyAccessToken);\r\n        request.send(null);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n//PromiseAll\r\nvar promiseAll = function(items, block, done, fail) {\r\n    var self = this;\r\n    var promises = [],\r\n                   index = 0;\r\n    items.forEach(function(item) {\r\n        promises.push(function(item, i) {\r\n            return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n                if (block) {\r\n                    block.apply(this, [item, index, resolve, reject]);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }(item, ++index))\r\n    });\r\n    Promise.all(promises).then(function AcceptHandler(results) {\r\n        if (done) done(results);\r\n    }, function ErrorHandler(error) {\r\n        if (fail) fail(error);\r\n    });\r\n};

                "The short answer is, you have to implement a callback like this:",
                "JavaScript is single threaded.The browser can be divided into three parts:Event LoopWeb APIEvent QueueThe event loop runs for forever, i.e., kind of an infinite loop. The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn't start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.That's where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn't any function left in our queue to utilise this data. Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.Thus the solution to this is callback or promise.We give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.In my code it is called as:JavaScript.info callback",

                "We find ourselves in a universe which appears to progress along a dimension we call \"time\". We don't really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: \"past\", \"present\", \"future\", \"before\", \"after\".The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called \"asynchronicity\". In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can't put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won't work:Because JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for order_milk to finish before it executes put_in_coffee. In other words, it does not know that order_milk is asynchronous--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.The classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the \"callback\" approach. It looks like this:order_milk kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes put_in_coffee.The problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with return; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let's say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:where I am passing to put_in_coffee both the milk to put in it, and also the action (drink_coffee) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.In this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:This was the motivation for the notion of a \"promise\", which is a particular type of value which represents a future or asynchronous outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named then, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.In the case of our milk and coffee, we design order_milk to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify put_in_coffee as a then action, as follows:One advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences (\"chaining\"):Let's apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:Actually, all we've done is added a return to the call to $.ajax. This works because jQuery's $.ajax already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to $.ajax that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply sayfor instance,When using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into then, so it's often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:But there's still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we writebut if a is asynchronous, with promises we have to writeAbove, we said, \"JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for the first call to finish before it executes the second\". Wouldn't it be nice if there was some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the await keyword, used inside a special type of function called an \"async\" function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as Babel given the right presets. This allows us to simply writeIn your case, you would be able to write something like",
                "Short answer: Your foo() method returns immediately, while the $ajax() call executes asynchronously after the function returns. The problem is then how or where to store the results retrieved by the async call once it returns.Several solutions have been given in this thread. Perhaps the easiest way is to pass an object to the foo() method, and to store the results in a member of that object after the async call completes.Note that the call to foo() will still return nothing useful. However, the result of the async call will now be stored in result.response.",

THE END!');\n});\n\nconsole.log('LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!');\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }Note how the function asynchronousCall is void. It returns nothing.\nInstead, by calling asynchronousCall with an anonymous callback function\n(asynchronousCall(function (result) {...), this function executes the\ndesired actions on the result, but only after the request has completed \u2013\nwhen the responseText is available.Running the above snippet shows how I will probably not want to write any code\nafter the asyncronous call (such as the line\nLAST in the code, but executed FIRST!).\nWhy? \u2013 Because such code will\nhappen before the asyncronous call delivers any response data.\nDoing so is bound to cause confusion when comparing the code with the output.The .then() construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 6th Edition in June\n2015, and the async/await construct was introduced in the ECMA-262\n8th Edition in June 2017.\nThe code below is still plain JavaScript, replacing the old-school\nXMLHttpRequest with Fetch.\n4fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(responseBody => {\n    console.log('.then() - the response body:');\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(responseBody) + '\\n\\n');\n  });\n\nasync function receiveAndAwaitPromise () {\n  const responseBody =\n    (await fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')).json();\n  console.log('async/await:');\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(await responseBody) + '\\n\\n');\n}\n\nreceiveAndAwaitPromise();\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }A word of warning is warranted if you decide to go with the async/await\nconstruct. Note in the above snippet how await is needed in two places.\nIf forgotten in the first place, there will be no output. If forgotten in the\nsecond place, the only output will be the empty object, {}\n(or [object Object] or [object Promise]).\nForgetting the async prefix of the function is maybe the worst of all \u2013 the\noutput will be \"SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical\" \u2013 no mentioning of\nthe missing async keyword.Suppose we need to request a whole bunch of URLs.\nI could send one request, wait till it responds, then send the next request,\nwait till it responds, and so on ...\nAargh! \u2013 That could take a loong time. Wouldn't it be better if I could send\nthem all at once, and then wait no longer than it takes for the slowest\nresponse to arrive?As a simplified example, I will use:The JSONs of the two URLs:The goal is to get an array of objects, where each object contains the title\nvalue from the corresponding URL.To make it a little more interesting, I will assume that there is already an\narray of names that I want the array of URL results (the titles) to be\nmerged with:The desired output is a mashup combining namesonly and urls into an\narray of objects:where I have changed the name of title to loremipsum.const namesonly = ['two','three'];\n\nconst urls = ['https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2',\n  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3'];\n\nPromise.all(urls.map(url => fetch(url)\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(responseBody => responseBody.title)))\n  .then(titles => {\n    const names = namesonly.map(value => ({ name: value }));\n    console.log('names: ' + JSON.stringify(names));\n    const latins = titles.map(value => ({ loremipsum: value }));\n    console.log('latins:\\n' + JSON.stringify(latins));\n    const result =\n      names.map((item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, latins[i]));\n    console.log('result:\\n' + JSON.stringify(result));\n  });\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }All the above examples are short and succinctly convey how asynchronous calls\nmay be used on toyish APIs.\nUsing small APIs works well to explain concepts and working code, but the\nexamples might be a bit of dry runs.The next section will show a more realistic example on how APIs may be\ncombined to create a more interesting output.The MusicBrainz API\nhas information about artists and music bands.\nAn example \u2013 a request for the British rock band Coldplay is:\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234?&fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups.\nThe JSON response contains \u2013 among other things \u2013 the 25 earliest album titles\nby the band.\nThis information is in the release-groups array.\nThe start of this array, including its first object is:This JSON snippet shows that the first album by Coldplay is Parachutes.\nIt also gives an id, in this case 1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843,\nwhich is a unique identifier of the album.This identifier can be used to make a lookup in the Cover Art Archive API:\nhttp://coverartarchive.org/release-group/1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843.\n7For each album, the JSON response contains some images, one of which is the\nfront cover of the album.\nThe first few lines of the response to the above request:Of interest here is the line\n\"small\": \"http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-250.jpg\".\nThat URL is a direct link to the front cover of the Parachutes album.The code to create and visualize the mashupThe overall task is to use Postman to visualize all the album titles and front\ncovers of a music band.\nHow to write code to achieve this has already been described in quite some\ndetail in  an answer to the question\nHow can I visualize an API mashup in Postman?

                "Of course there are many approaches like synchronous request, promise, but from my experience I think you should use the callback approach. It's natural to asynchronous behavior of JavaScript.So, your code snippet can be rewritten to be a little different:",
                "The question was:How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?which can be interpreted as:How to make asynchronous code look synchronous?The solution will be to avoid callbacks, and use a combination of Promises and async/await.I would like to give an example for an Ajax request.(Although it can be written in JavaScript, I prefer to write it in Python, and compile it to JavaScript using Transcrypt. It will be clear enough.)Let\u2019s first enable jQuery usage, to have $ available as S:Define a function which returns a Promise, in this case an Ajax call:Use the asynchronous code as if it were synchronous:",
                "Rather than throwing code at you, there are two concepts that are key to understanding how JavaScript handles callbacks and asynchronicity (is that even a word?)There are three things you need to be aware of; The queue; the event loop and the stackIn broad, simplistic terms, the event loop is like the project manager, it is constantly listening for any functions that want to run and communicates between the queue and the stack.Once it receives a message to run something it adds it to the queue. The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it's being told to call foobarFuncSo anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case anotherFunction) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)The key thing here is the order of execution. That isWhen you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don't know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say \"hey run me\". If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.That's why with asynchronous functionality we use things called callbacks. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A promise uses callbacks (functions passed to .then() for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying \"I promise to return something at some point\" and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called deffered.done deffered.fail and deffered.always (amongst others). You can see them all hereSo what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.Because a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it's important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. soso most of the time (but not always) you'll pass foo not foo()Hopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer."

Android defines a\nminimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an\nAndroid screen size guideline.\n\nWhen we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design\nthe Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics\nand bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density\nguideline.For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between\nthe four generalized densities. If we create a 36\u00d736 pixel picture for\nldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48\u00d748 for mdpi,\n72\u00d772 for hdpi, and 96\u00d796 for xhdpi.How to Design Android Apps UI in PhotoshopMany designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel\nbased graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp.\nDesigners don\u2019t know how to map dp to pixel.

                "The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as pixels (px). A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.Density independent pixel (dp or dip) allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpiwhere,dpi is dots per inchSo, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.Formulapx/dp = dpi/160dpiDots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)Scale independent pixels(sp) is the preferred unit for font size.\nFor accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.Reference: Udacity, Google",

It's because git rebase with no arguments enables the --fork-point option by default, which uses the local reflog to try to be robust against the upstream branch being force-pushed.Suppose you branched off origin/master when it contained commits M1, M2, M3, then made three commits yourself:but then someone rewrites history by force-pushing origin/master to remove M2:Using your local reflog, git rebase can see that you forked from an earlier incarnation of the origin/master branch, and hence that the M2 and M3 commits are not really part of your topic branch. Hence it reasonably assumes that since M2 was removed from the upstream branch, you no longer want it in your topic branch either once the topic branch is rebased:This behavior makes sense, and is generally the right thing to do when rebasing.So the reason that the following commands fail:is because they leave the reflog in the wrong state. Git sees newbranch as having forked off the upstream branch at a revision that includes the 3 commits, then the reset --hard rewrites the upstream's history to remove the commits, and so next time you run git rebase it discards them like any other commit that has been removed from the upstream.But in this particular case we want those 3 commits to be considered as part of the topic branch. To achieve that, we need to fork off the upstream at the earlier revision that doesn't include the 3 commits. That's what my suggested solutions do, hence they both leave the reflog in the correct state.For more details, see the definition of --fork-point in the git rebase and git merge-base docs.",

                "Overall:Both PUT and POST can be used for creating.You have to ask, \"what are you performing the action upon?\", to distinguish what you should be using. Let's assume you're designing an API for asking questions.  If you want to use POST, then you would do that to a list of questions. If you want to use PUT, then you would do that to a particular question.Great, both can be used, so which one should I use in my RESTful design:You do not need to support both PUT and POST.Which you use is up to you.  But just remember to use the right one depending on what object you are referencing in the request.Some considerations:An example:I wrote the following as part of another answer on SO regarding this:POST:Used to modify and update a resourceNote that the following is an error:If the URL is not yet created, you\nshould not be using POST to create it\nwhile specifying the name.  This should\nresult in a 'resource not found' error\nbecause <new_question> does not exist\nyet.  You should PUT the <new_question>\nresource on the server first.You could though do something like\nthis to create a resources using POST:Note that in this case the resource\nname is not specified, the new objects\nURL path would be returned to you.PUT:Used to create a resource, or\noverwrite it.  While you specify the\nresources new URL.For a new resource:To overwrite an existing resource:Additionally, and a bit more concisely, RFC 7231 Section 4.3.4 PUT states (emphasis added),4.3.4.  PUTThe PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be\ncreated or replaced with the state defined by the representation\nenclosed in the request message payload.",
                "You can find assertions on the web that sayNeither is quite right.Better is to choose between PUT and POST based on idempotence of the action.PUT implies putting a resource - completely replacing whatever is available at the given URL with a different thing.  By definition, a PUT is idempotent.  Do it as many times as you like, and the result is the same. x=5 is idempotent.  You can PUT a resource whether it previously exists, or not (eg, to Create, or to Update)!POST updates a resource, adds a subsidiary resource, or causes a change.  A POST is not idempotent, in the way that x++ is not idempotent.By this argument, PUT is for creating when you know the URL of the thing you will create. POST can be used to create when you know the URL of the \"factory\" or manager for the category of things you want to create.so:or:",
                "The relevant specification for PUT and POST is RFC 2616 \u00a79.5ff.POST creates a child resource, so POST to /items creates a resources that lives under the /items resource.\nEg. /items/1. Sending the same post packet twice will create two resources.PUT is for creating or replacing a resource at a URL known by the client.Therefore: PUT is only a candidate for CREATE where the client already knows the url before the resource is created. Eg. /blogs/nigel/entry/when_to_use_post_vs_put as the title is used as the resource keyPUT replaces the resource at the known url if it already exists, so sending the same request twice has no effect. In other words, calls to PUT are idempotent.The RFC reads like this:The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI,Note: PUT has mostly been used to update resources (by replacing them in their entireties), but recently there is movement towards using PATCH for updating existing resources, as PUT specifies that it replaces the whole resource. RFC 5789.Update 2018: There is a case that can be made to avoid PUT. See \"REST without PUT\"With \u201cREST without PUT\u201d technique, the idea is that consumers are\nforced to post new 'nounified' request resources. As discussed\nearlier, changing a customer\u2019s mailing address is a POST to a new\n\u201cChangeOfAddress\u201d resource, not a PUT of a \u201cCustomer\u201d resource with a\ndifferent mailing address field value.taken from REST API Design - Resource Modeling by Prakash Subramaniam of ThoughtworksThis forces the API to avoid state transition problems with multiple clients updating a single resource, and matches more nicely with event sourcing and CQRS. When the work is done asynchronously, POSTing the transformation and waiting for it to be applied seems appropriate.",
                "POST means \"create new\" as in \"Here is the input for creating a user, create it for me\".PUT means \"insert, replace if already exists\" as in \"Here is the data for user 5\".You POST to example.com/users since you don't know the URL of the user yet, you want the server to create it.You PUT to example.com/users/id since you want to replace/create a specific user.POSTing twice with the same data means create two identical users with different ids. PUTing twice with the same data creates the user the first and updates him to the same state the second time (no changes). Since you end up with the same state after a PUT no matter how many times you perform it, it is said to be \"equally potent\" every time - idempotent. This is useful for automatically retrying requests. No more 'are you sure you want to resend' when you push the back button on the browser.A general advice is to use POST when you need the server to be in control of URL generation of your resources. Use PUT otherwise.  Prefer PUT  over POST.",

So when you say:you are telling to the server update, or create if it doesn't exist, the john resource under the users collection.Let me highlight some important parts of the spec:The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-LineHence, creates a new resource on a collection.The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.

                "REST is a very high-level concept. In fact, it doesn't even mention HTTP at all!If you have any doubts about how to implement REST in HTTP, you can always take a look at the Atom Publication Protocol (AtomPub) specification. AtomPub is a standard for writing RESTful webservices with HTTP that was developed by many HTTP and REST luminaries, with some input from Roy Fielding, the inventor of REST and (co-)inventor of HTTP himself.In fact, you might even be able to use AtomPub directly. While it came out of the blogging community, it is in no way restricted to blogging: it is a generic protocol for RESTfully interacting with arbitrary (nested) collections of arbitrary resources via HTTP. If you can represent your application as a nested collection of resources, then you can just use AtomPub and not worry about whether to use PUT or POST, what HTTP Status Codes to return and all those details.This is what AtomPub has to say about resource creation (section 9.2):To add members to a Collection, clients send POST requests to the URI of the Collection.",
                "The decision of whether to use PUT or POST to create a resource on a server with an HTTP + REST API is based on who owns the URL structure. Having the client know, or participate in defining, the URL struct is an unnecessary coupling akin to the undesirable couplings that arose from SOA. Escaping types of couplings is the reason REST is so popular. Therefore, the proper method to use is POST. There are exceptions to this rule and they occur when the client wishes to retain control over the location structure of the resources it deploys. This is rare and likely means something else is wrong.At this point some people will argue that if RESTful-URL's are used, the client does knows the URL of the resource and therefore a PUT is acceptable. After all, this is why canonical, normalized, Ruby on Rails, Django URLs are important, look at the Twitter API \u2026 blah blah blah. Those people need to understand there is no such thing as a Restful-URL and that Roy Fielding himself states that:A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an\nobvious coupling of client and server). Servers must have the freedom\nto control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct\nclients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML\nforms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media\ntypes and link relations. [Failure here implies that clients are\nassuming a resource structure due to out-of band information, such as\na domain-specific standard, which is the data-oriented equivalent to\nRPC's functional coupling].http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-drivenThe idea of a RESTful-URL is actually a violation of REST as the server is in charge of the URL structure and should be free to decide how to use it to avoid coupling. If this confuses you read about the significance of self discovery on API design.Using POST to create resources comes with a design consideration because POST is not idempotent. This means that repeating a POST several times does not guarantee the same behavior each time. This scares people into using PUT to create resources when they should not. They know it's wrong (POST is for CREATE) but they do it anyway because they don't know how to solve this problem.  This concern is demonstrated in the following situation:Step 6 is where people commonly get confused about what to do. However, there is no reason to create a kludge to solve this issue. Instead, HTTP can be used as specified in RFC 2616 and the server replies:10.4.10 409 ConflictThe request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current\nstate of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where\nit is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and\nresubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enoughinformation for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.\nIdeally, the response entity would include enough information for the\nuser or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be\npossible and is not required.Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For\nexample, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT\nincluded changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an\nearlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response\nto indicate that it can\u2019t complete the request. In this case, the\nresponse entity would likely contain a list of the differences between\nthe two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.Replying with a status code of 409 Conflict is the correct recourse because:Update based on release of RFC 7231 to Replace 2616RFC 7231 is designed to replace 2616 and in Section 4.3.3 describes the follow possible response for a POSTIf the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a\nrepresentation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect\nthe user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response\nwith the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.  This\nhas the benefits of providing the user agent a resource identifier\nand transferring the representation via a method more amenable to\nshared caching, though at the cost of an extra request if the user\nagent does not already have the representation cached.It now may be tempting to simply return a 303 in the event that a POST is repeated. However, the opposite is true. Returning a 303 would only make sense if multiple create requests (creating different resources) return the same content. An example would be a \"thank you for submitting your request message\" that the client need not re-download each time. RFC 7231 still maintains in section 4.2.2 that POST is not to be idempotent and continues to maintain that POST should be used for create.For more information about this, read this article.",

In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.This jibes with the other advice here, that PUT is best applied to resources that already have a name, and POST is good for creating a new object under an existing resource (and letting the server name it).I interpret this, and the idempotency requirements on PUT, to mean that:",
                "In short:PUT is idempotent, where the resource state will be the same if the same operation is executed one time or multiple times.POST is non-idempotent, where the resource state may become different if the operation is executed multiple times as compared to executing a single time.PUT You can think of similar to \"UPDATE STUDENT SET address = \"abc\" where id=\"123\";POST You can think of something like \"INSERT INTO STUDENT(name, address) VALUES (\"abc\", \"xyzzz\");Student Id is auto generated.With PUT, if the same query is executed multiple times or one time, the STUDENT table state remains the same.In case of POST, if the same query is executed multiple times then multiple Student records get created in the database and the database state changes on each execution of an \"INSERT\" query.NOTE: PUT needs a resource location (already-resource) on which update needs to happen, whereas POST doesn't require that. Therefore intuitively POST is meant for creation of a new resource, whereas PUT is needed for updating the already existing resource.Some may come up with that updates can be performed with POST. There is no hard rule which one to use for updates or which one to use for create. Again these are conventions, and intuitively I'm inclined with the above mentioned reasoning and follow it.",

We could have lived without PUT as well. But from a client developer's point of view it made his/her life a lot simpler.Prior to PUT, clients couldn't directly know the URL that the server generated or if all it had generated any or whether the data to be sent to the server is already updated or not. PUT relieved the developer of all these headaches. PUT is idempotent, PUT handles race conditions, and PUT lets the client choose the URL.",
                "New answer (now that I understand REST better):PUT is merely a statement of what content the service should, from now on, use to render representations of the resource identified by the client; POST is a statement of what content the service should, from now on, contain (possibly duplicated) but it's up to the server how to identify that content.PUT x (if x identifies a resource): \"Replace the content of the resource identified by x with my content.\"PUT x (if x does not identify a resource): \"Create a new resource containing my content and use x to identify it.\"POST x: \"Store my content and give me an identifier that I can use to identify a resource (old or new) containing said content (possibly mixed with other content). Said resource should be identical or subordinate to that which x identifies.\" \"y's resource is subordinate to x's resource\" is typically but not necessarily implemented by making y a subpath of x (e.g. x = /foo and y = /foo/bar) and modifying the representation(s) of x's resource to reflect the existence of a new resource, e.g. with a hyperlink to y's resource and some metadata. Only the latter is really essential to good design, as URLs are opaque in REST -- you're supposed to use hypermedia instead of client-side URL construction to traverse the service anyways.In REST, there's no such thing as a resource containing \"content\". I refer as \"content\" to data that the service uses to render representations consistently. It typically consists of some related rows in a database or a file (e.g. an image file). It's up to the service to convert the user's content into something the service can use, e.g. converting a JSON payload into SQL statements.Original answer (might be easier to read):PUT /something (if /something already exists): \"Take whatever you have at /something and replace it with what I give you.\"PUT /something (if /something does not already exist): \"Take what I give you and put it at /something.\"POST /something: \"Take what I give you and put it anywhere you want under /something as long as you give me its URL when you're done.\"",

                "Readers new to this topic will be struck by the endless discussion about what you should do, and the relative absence of lessons from experience. The fact that REST is \"preferred\" over SOAP is, I suppose, a high-level learning from experience, but goodness we must have progressed from there? It's 2016. Roy's dissertation was in 2000. What have we developed? Was it fun? Was it easy to integrate with? To support? Will it handle the rise of smartphones and flaky mobile connections?According to ME, real-life networks are unreliable. Requests timeout. Connections are reset. Networks go down for hours or days at a time. Trains go into tunnels with mobile users aboard. For any given request (as occasionally acknowledged in all this discussion) the request can fall in the water on its way, or the response can fall in the water on its way back. In these conditions, issuing PUT, POST and DELETE requests directly against substantive resources has always struck me as a little brutal and naive.HTTP does nothing to ensure reliable completion of the request-response, and that's just fine because this is properly the job of network-aware applications. Developing such an application, you can jump through hoops to use PUT instead of POST, then more hoops to give a certain kind of error on the server if you detect duplicate requests. Back at the client, you then have to jump through hoops to interpret these errors, refetch, revalidate and repost.Or you can do this: consider your unsafe requests as ephemeral single-user resources (let's call them actions). Clients request a new \"action\" on a substantive resource with an empty POST to the resource. POST will be used only for this. Once safely in possession of the URI of the freshly minted action, the client PUTs the unsafe request to the action URI, not the target resource. Resolving the action and updating the \"real\" resource is properly the job of your API, and is here decoupled from the unreliable network.The server does the business, returns the response and stores it against the agreed action URI. If anything goes wrong, the client repeats the request (natural behaviour!), and if the server has already seen it, it repeats the stored response and does nothing else.You will quickly spot the similarity with promises: we create and return the placeholder for the result before doing anything. Also like a promise, an action can succeed or fail one time, but its result can be fetched repeatedly.Best of all, we give sending and receiving applications a chance to link the uniquely identified action to uniqueness in their respective environments. And we can start to demand, and enforce!, responsible behaviour from clients: repeat your requests as much as you like, but don't go generating a new action until you're in possession of a definitive result from the existing one.As such, numerous thorny problems go away. Repeated insert requests won't create duplicates, and we don't create the real resource until we're in possession of the data. (database columns can stay not-nullable). Repeated update requests won't hit incompatible states and won't overwrite subsequent changes. Clients can (re)fetch and seamlessy process the original confirmation for whatever reason (client crashed, response went missing, etc.).Successive delete requests can see and process the original confirmation, without hitting a 404 error. If things take longer than expected, we can respond provisionally, and we have a place where the client can check back for the definitive result. The nicest part of this pattern is its Kung-Fu (Panda) property. We take a weakness, the propensity for clients to repeat a request any time they don't understand the response, and turn it into a strength :-)Before telling me this is not RESTful, please consider the numerous ways in which REST principles are respected. Clients don't construct URLs. The API stays discoverable, albeit with a little change in semantics. HTTP verbs are used appropriately. If you think this is a huge change to implement, I can tell you from experience that it's not.If you think you'll have huge amounts of data to store, let's talk volumes: a typical update confirmation is a fraction of a kilobyte. HTTP currently gives you a minute or two to respond definitively. Even if you only store actions for a week, clients have ample chance to catch up. If you have very high volumes, you may want a dedicated acid-compliant key value store, or an in-memory solution.",
                "There seems to always be some confusion as to when to use the HTTP POST versus the HTTP PUT method for REST services. Most developers will try to associate CRUD operations directly to HTTP methods. I will argue that this is not correct and one can not simply associate the CRUD concepts to the HTTP methods. That is:It is true that the R(etrieve) and D(elete) of the CRUD operations can be mapped directly to the HTTP methods GET and DELETE respectively. However, the confusion lies in the C(reate) and U(update) operations. In some cases, one can use the PUT for a create while in other cases a POST will be required. The ambiguity lies in the definition of an HTTP PUT method versus an HTTP POST method.According to the HTTP 1.1 specifications the GET, HEAD, DELETE, and PUT methods must be idempotent, and the POST method is not idempotent. That is to say that an operation is idempotent if it can be performed on a resource once or many times and always return the same state of that resource. Whereas a non idempotent operation can return a modified state of the resource from one request to another. Hence, in a non idempotent operation, there is no guarantee that one will receive the same state of a resource.Based on the above idempotent definition, my take on using the HTTP PUT method versus using the HTTP POST method for REST services is:\nUse the HTTP PUT method when:In both cases, these operations can be performed multiple times with the same results. That is the resource will not be changed by requesting the operation more than once. Hence, a true idempotent operation.\nUse the HTTP POST method when:ConclusionDo not directly correlate and map CRUD operations to HTTP methods for REST services. The use of an HTTP PUT method versus an HTTP POST method should be based on the idempotent aspect of that operation. That is, if the operation is idempotent, then use the HTTP PUT method. If the operation is non idempotent, then use the HTTP POST method.",
                "the origin server can create the resource with that URISo you use POST and probably, but not necessary PUT for resource creation. You don't have to support both. For me POST is perfectly enough. So it is a design decision.As your quote mentioned, you use PUT for creation of there is no resource assigned to an IRI, and you want to create a resource anyway. For example, PUT /users/123/password usually replaces the old password with a new one, but you can use it to create a password if it does not exist already (for example, by freshly registered users or by restoring banned users).",
                "I'm going to land with the following:PUT refers to a resource, identified by the URI. In this case, you are updating it. It is the part of the three verbs referring to resources -- delete and get being the other two.POST is basically a free form message, with its meaning being defined 'out of band'. If the message can be interpreted as adding a resource to a directory, that would be OK, but basically you need to understand the message you are sending (posting) to know what will happen with the resource.Because PUT and GET and DELETE refer to a resource, they are also by definition idempotent.POST can perform the other three functions, but then the semantics of the request will be lost on the intermediaries such as caches and proxies. This also applies to providing security on the resource, since a post's URI doesn't necessarily indicate the resource it is applying to (it can though).A PUT doesn't need to be a create; the service could error if the resource isn't already created, but otherwise update it. Or vice versa -- it may create the resource, but not allow updates. The only thing required about PUT is that it points to a specific resource, and its payload is the representation of that resource. A successful PUT means (barring interference) that a GET would retrieve the same resource.Edit: One more thing -- a PUT can create, but if it does then the ID has to be a natural ID -- AKA an email address. That way when you PUT twice, the second put is an update of the first. This makes it idempotent.If the ID is generated (a new employee ID, for example), then the second PUT with the same URL would create a new record, which violates the idempotent rule. In this case the verb would be POST, and the message (not resource) would be to create a resource using the values defined in this message.",
                "Here's a simple rule:PUT to a URL should be used to update or create the resource that can be located at that URL.POST to a URL should be used to update or create a resource which is located at some other (\"subordinate\") URL, or is not locatable via HTTP.",
                "The semantics are supposed be different, in that \"PUT\", like \"GET\" is supposed to be idempotent -- meaning, you can the same exact PUT request multiple times and the result will be as if you executed it only once.I will describe the conventions which I think are most widely used and are most useful:When you PUT a resource at a particular URL what happens is that it should get saved at that URL, or something along those lines.When you POST to a resource at a particular URL, often you are posting a related piece of information to that URL. This implies that the resource at the URL already exists.For example, when you want to create a new stream, you can PUT it to some URL. But when you want to POST a message to an existing stream, you POST to its URL.As for modifying the properties of the stream, you can do that with either PUT or POST. Basically, only use \"PUT\" when the operation is idempotent - otherwise use POST.Note, however, that not all modern browsers support HTTP verbs other than GET or POST.",
                "Most of the time, you will use them like this:For example:In both cases, the request body contains the data for the resource to be created or updated. It should be obvious from the route names that POST is not idempotent (if you call it 3 times it will create 3 objects), but PUT is idempotent (if you call it 3 times the result is the same). PUT is often used for \"upsert\" operation (create or update), but you can always return a 404 error if you only want to use it to modify.Note that POST \"creates\" a new element in the collection, and PUT \"replaces\" an element at a given URL, but it is a very common practice to use PUT for partial modifications, that is, use it only to update existing resources and only modify the included fields in the body (ignoring the other fields). This is technically incorrect, if you want to be REST-purist, PUT should replace the whole resource and you should use PATCH for the partial update. I personally don't care much as far as the behavior is clear and consistent across all your API endpoints.Remember, REST is a set of conventions and guidelines to keep your API simple. If you end up with a complicated work-around just to check the \"RESTfull\" box then you are defeating the purpose ;)",

                "The old versions of JavaScript had no import, include, or require, so many different approaches to this problem have been developed.But since 2015 (ES6), JavaScript has had the ES6 modules standard to import modules in Node.js, which is also supported by most modern browsers.For compatibility with older browsers, build tools like Webpack and Rollup and/or transpilation tools like Babel can be used.ECMAScript (ES6) modules have been supported in Node.js since v8.5, with the --experimental-modules flag, and since at least Node.js v13.8.0 without the flag. To enable \"ESM\" (vs. Node.js's previous CommonJS-style module system [\"CJS\"]) you either use \"type\": \"module\" in package.json or give the files the extension .mjs. (Similarly, modules written with Node.js's previous CJS module can be named .cjs if your default is ESM.)Using package.json:Then module.js:Then main.js:Using .mjs, you'd have module.mjs:Then main.mjs:Browsers have had support for loading ECMAScript modules directly (no tools like Webpack required) since Safari 10.1, Chrome 61, Firefox 60, and Edge 16. Check the current support at caniuse. There is no need to use Node.js' .mjs extension; browsers completely ignore file extensions on modules/scripts.Read more at https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/Dynamic imports let the script load other scripts as needed:Read more at https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-importThe older CJS module style, still widely used in Node.js, is the module.exports/require system.There are other ways for JavaScript to include external JavaScript contents in browsers that do not require preprocessing.You could load an additional script with an AJAX call and then use eval to run it. This is the most straightforward way, but it is limited to your domain because of the JavaScript sandbox security model. Using eval also opens the door to bugs, hacks and security issues.Like Dynamic Imports you can load one or many scripts with a fetch call using promises to control order of execution for script dependencies using the Fetch Inject library:The jQuery library provides loading functionality in one line:You could add a script tag with the script URL into the HTML. To avoid the overhead of jQuery, this is an ideal solution.The script can even reside on a different server. Furthermore, the browser evaluates the code. The <script> tag can be injected into either the web page <head>, or inserted just before the closing </body> tag.Here is an example of how this could work:This function will add a new <script> tag to the end of the head section of the page, where the src attribute is set to the URL which is given to the function as the first parameter.Both of these solutions are discussed and illustrated in JavaScript Madness: Dynamic Script Loading.Now, there is a big issue you must know about. Doing that implies that you remotely load the code. Modern web browsers will load the file and keep executing your current script because they load everything asynchronously to improve performance. (This applies to both the jQuery method and the manual dynamic script loading method.)It means that if you use these tricks directly, you won't be able to use your newly loaded code the next line after you asked it to be loaded, because it will be still loading.For example: my_lovely_script.js contains MySuperObject:Then you reload the page hitting F5. And it works! Confusing...So what to do about it ?Well, you can use the hack the author suggests in the link I gave you. In summary, for people in a hurry, he uses an event to run a callback function when the script is loaded. So you can put all the code using the remote library in the callback function. For example:Then you write the code you want to use AFTER the script is loaded in a lambda function:Then you run all that:Note that the script may execute after the DOM has loaded, or before, depending on the browser and whether you included the line script.async = false;. There's a great article on Javascript loading in general which discusses this.As mentioned at the top of this answer, many developers use build/transpilation tool(s) like Parcel, Webpack, or Babel in their projects, allowing them to use upcoming JavaScript syntax, provide backward compatibility for older browsers, combine files, minify, perform code splitting etc.",
                "If anyone is looking for something more advanced, try out RequireJS. You'll get added benefits such as dependency management, better concurrency, and avoid duplication (that is, retrieving a script more than once).You can write your JavaScript files in \"modules\" and then reference them as dependencies in other scripts. Or you can use RequireJS as a simple \"go get this script\" solution.Example:Define dependencies as modules:some-dependency.jsimplementation.js is your \"main\" JavaScript file that depends on some-dependency.jsExcerpt from the GitHub README:RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined\n  modules. It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web\n  Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like\n  Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API.RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should\n  allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing\n  JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without\n  having to re-write your JavaScript files....",
                "There actually is a way to load a JavaScript file not asynchronously, so you could use the functions included in your newly loaded file right after loading it, and I think it works in all browsers.You need to use jQuery.append() on the <head> element of your page, that is:However, this method also has a problem: if an error happens in the imported JavaScript file, Firebug (and also Firefox Error Console and Chrome Developer Tools as well) will report its place incorrectly, which is a big problem if you use Firebug to track JavaScript errors down a lot (I do). Firebug simply doesn't know about the newly loaded file for some reason, so if an error occurs in that file, it reports that it occurred in your main HTML file, and you will have trouble finding out the real reason for the error.But if that is not a problem for you, then this method should work.I have actually written a jQuery plugin called $.import_js() which uses this method:So all you would need to do to import JavaScript is:I also made a simple test for this at Example.It includes a main.js file in the main HTML and then the script in main.js uses $.import_js() to import an additional file called included.js, which defines this function:And right after including included.js, the hello() function is called, and you get the alert.(This answer is in response to e-satis' comment).",

Here are the two most popular ones:Browsers do not support this moduling system yet, so in order for you to use this syntax you must use a bundler like Webpack. Using a bundler is better anyway because this can combine all of your different files into a single (or a couple of related) files. This will serve the files from the server to the client faster because each HTTP request has some associated overhead accompanied with it. Thus by reducing the overall HTTP request we improve the performance. Here is an example of ES6 modules:This moduling system is used in Node.js. You basically add your exports to an object which is called module.exports. You then can access this object via a require('modulePath').

Variables declared by var keyword are scoped to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) while let variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by { } (hence the block scope).function run() {\n  var foo = \"Foo\";\n  let bar = \"Bar\";\n\n  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar\n\n  {\n    var moo = \"Mooo\"\n    let baz = \"Bazz\";\n    console.log(moo, baz); // Mooo Bazz\n  }\n\n  console.log(moo); // Mooo\n  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError\n}\n\nrun();The reason why let keyword was introduced to the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.Take a look at this example from another Stack Overflow question:var funcs = [];\n// let's create 3 functions\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  // and store them in funcs\n  funcs[i] = function() {\n    // each should log its value.\n    console.log(\"My value: \" + i);\n  };\n}\nfor (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n  // and now let's run each one to see\n  funcs[j]();\n}My value: 3 was output to console each time funcs[j](); was invoked since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.People had to create immediately invoked functions to capture correct values from the loops but that was also hairy.While variables declared with var keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which means they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:function run() {\n  console.log(foo); // undefined\n  var foo = \"Foo\";\n  console.log(foo); // Foo\n}\n\nrun();let variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization results in a ReferenceError.

Yet, our variable i is known in the entire function.Also, consider that block scoped variables are not known before they are declared because they are not hoisted. You're also not allowed to redeclare the same block scoped variable within the same block. This makes block scoped variables less error prone than globally or functionally scoped variables, which are hoisted and which do not produce any errors in case of multiple declarations.Some people would argue that in the future we'll ONLY use let statements and that var statements will become obsolete. JavaScript guru Kyle Simpson wrote a very elaborate article on why he believes that won't be the case.Today, however, that is definitely not the case. In fact, we need actually to ask ourselves whether it's safe to use the let statement. The answer to that question depends on your environment:If you're writing server-side JavaScript code (Node.js), you can safely use the let statement.If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and use a browser based transpiler (like Traceur or babel-standalone), you can safely use the let statement, however your code is likely to be anything but optimal with respect to performance.If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and use a Node based transpiler (like the traceur shell script or Babel), you can safely use the let statement. And, because your browser will only know about the transpiled code, performance drawbacks should be limited.If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and don't use a transpiler, you need to consider browser support.There are still some browsers that don't support let at all :For an up-to-date overview of which browsers support the let statement at the time of your reading this answer, see this Can I Use page.(*) Globally and functionally scoped variables can be initialized and used before they are declared because JavaScript variables are hoisted. This means that declarations are always moved to the top of the scope.(**) Block scoped variables are not hoisted",

That means that you can safely use a closure inside a loop.Because of the temporal dead zone, variables declared using let can't be accessed before they are declared.

From the documentation in MDN (examples also from MDN):let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.Variables declared by let have as their scope the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let works very much like var. The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function:At the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object. For example:When used inside a block, let limits the variable's scope to that block.

By contrast, var could hoist as below.Actually, Per @Bergi, Both var and let are hoisted.Garbage CollectionBlock scope of let is useful relates to closures and garbage collection to reclaim memory. Consider,The click handler callback does not need the hugeData variable at all. Theoretically, after process(..) runs, the huge data structure hugeData could be garbage collected. However, it's possible that some JS engine will still have to keep this huge structure, since the click function has a closure over the entire scope.However, the block scope can make this huge data structure to garbage collected.let loopslet in the loop can re-binds it to each iteration of the loop, making sure to re-assign it the value from the end of the previous loop iteration. Consider,However, replace var with letBecause let create a new lexical environment with those names for a) the initialiser expression b) each iteration (previosly to evaluating the increment expression), more details are here.",
                "The difference is in the scope of the variables declared with each.In practice, there are a number of useful consequences of the difference in scope:The restrictions imposed by let reduce the visibility of the variables and increase the likelihood that unexpected name collisions will be found early.  This makes it easier to track and reason about variables, including their reachability(helping with reclaiming unused memory).Consequently, let variables are less likely to cause problems when used in large programs or when independently-developed frameworks are combined in new and unexpected ways.var may still be useful if you are sure you want the single-binding effect when using a closure in a loop (#5) or for declaring externally-visible global variables in your code (#4).  Use of var for exports may be supplanted if export migrates out of transpiler space and into the core language.1. No use outside nearest enclosing block:\nThis block of code will throw a reference error because the second use of x occurs outside of the block where it is declared with let:In contrast, the same example with var works.2. No use before declaration:\nThis block of code will throw a ReferenceError before the code can be run because x is used before it is declared:In contrast, the same example with var parses and runs without throwing any exceptions.3. No redeclaration:\nThe following code demonstrates that a variable declared with let may not be redeclared later:4. Globals not attached to window:5. Easy use with closures:\nVariables declared with var do not work well with closures inside loops.  Here is a simple loop that outputs the sequence of values that the variable i has at different points in time:Specifically, this outputs:In JavaScript we often use variables at a significantly later time than when they are created.  When we demonstrate this by delaying the output with a closure passed to setTimeout:... the output remains unchanged as long as we stick with let.  In contrast, if we had used var i instead:... the loop unexpectedly outputs \"i is 5\" five times:",
                "Here's an example to add on to what others have already written. Suppose you want to make an array of functions, adderFunctions, where each function takes a single Number argument and returns the sum of the argument and the function's index in the array. Trying to generate adderFunctions with a loop using the var keyword won't work the way someone might na\u00efvely expect:The process above doesn't generate the desired array of functions because i's scope extends beyond the iteration of the for block in which each function was created. Instead, at the end of the loop, the i in each function's closure refers to i's value at the end of the loop (1000) for every anonymous function in adderFunctions. This isn't what we wanted at all: we now have an array of 1000 different functions in memory with exactly the same behavior. And if we subsequently update the value of i, the mutation will affect all the adderFunctions.However, we can try again using the let keyword:This time, i is rebound on each iteration of the for loop. Each function now keeps the value of i at the time of the function's creation, and adderFunctions behaves as expected.Now, image mixing the two behaviors and you'll probably see why it's not recommended to mix the newer let and const with the older var in the same script. Doing so can result is some spectacularly confusing code.Don't let this happen to you. Use a linter.NOTE: This is a teaching example intended to demonstrate the var/let behavior in loops and with function closures that would also be easy to understand. This would be a terrible way to add numbers. But the general technique of capturing data in anonymous function closures might be encountered in the real world in other contexts. YMMV.",

                "The main difference between var and let is that variables declared with var are function scoped. Whereas functions declared with let are block scoped. For example:variables with var:When the first function testVar gets called the variable foo, declared with var, is still accessible outside the if statement. This variable foo would be available everywhere within the scope of the testVar function.variables with let:When the second function testLet gets called the variable bar, declared with let, is only accessible inside the if statement. Because variables declared with let are block scoped (where a block is the code between curly brackets e.g if{} , for{}, function{}).Another difference between var and let is variables with declared with let don't get hoisted. An example is the best way to illustrate this behavior:variables with let don't get hoisted:variables with var do get hoisted:A variable declared with let in the global scope (which is code that is not in a function) doesn't get added as a property on the global window object. For example (this code is in global scope):When should let be used over var?Use let over var whenever you can because it is simply scoped more specific. This reduces potential naming conflicts which can occur when dealing with a large number of variables. var can be used when you want a global variable explicitly to be on the window object (always consider carefully if this is really necessary).",

If your script needs to change directory for some reason, then the output from dirname becomes meaningless.I suggest the following:This way, you get an absolute, rather than a relative directory.Since the script will be run in a separate Bash instance, there isn't any need to restore the working directory afterwards, but if you do want to change back in your script for some reason, you can easily assign the value of pwd to a variable before you change directory, for future use.Although justsolves the specific scenario in the question, I find having the absolute path to more more useful generally.",

This can be easily accomplished using realpath. Note that realpath is part of GNU coreutils. If you don't have it already installed (it comes default on Ubuntu), you can install it with sudo apt update && sudo apt install coreutils.get_script_path.sh (for the latest version of this script, see get_script_path.sh in my eRCaGuy_hello_world repo):IMPORTANT note on nested source calls: if \"${BASH_SOURCE[-1]}\" above doesn't give you quite what you want, try using \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" instead. The first (0) index gives you the first entry in the array, and the last (-1) index gives you the last last entry in the array. Depending on what it is you're after, you may actually want the first entry. I discovered this to be the case when I sourced ~/.bashrc with . ~/.bashrc, which sourced ~/.bash_aliases with . ~/.bash_aliases, and I wanted the realpath (with expanded symlinks) to the ~/.bash_aliases file, NOT to the ~/.bashrc file. Since these are nested source calls, using \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" gave me what I wanted: the expanded path to ~/.bash_aliases! Using \"${BASH_SOURCE[-1]}\", however, gave me what I did not want: the expanded path to ~/.bashrc.Example command and output:If you use \"$0\" in the script instead of \"${BASH_SOURCE[-1]}\", you'll get the same output as above when running the script, but this undesired output instead when sourcing the script:And, apparently if you use \"$BASH_SOURCE\" instead of \"${BASH_SOURCE[-1]}\", it will not work if the script is called from within another bash function. So, using \"${BASH_SOURCE[-1]}\" is therefore the best way to do it, as it solves both of these problems! See the references below.Difference between realpath and realpath -s:Note that realpath also successfully walks down symbolic links to determine and point to their targets rather than pointing to the symbolic link. If you do NOT want this behavior (sometimes I don't), then add -s to the realpath command above, making that line look like this instead:This way, symbolic links are NOT expanded. Rather, they are left as-is, as symbolic links in the full path.The code above is now part of my eRCaGuy_hello_world repo in this file here: bash/get_script_path.sh.

These seem to handle all of the crazy edge cases that arise from your favorite combination of:If you're running from Linux, it seems that using the proc handle is the best solution to locate the fully resolved source of the currently running script (in an interactive session, the link points to the respective /dev/pts/X):This has a small bit of ugliness to it, but the fix is compact and easy to understand. We aren't using bash primitives only, but I'm okay with that because readlink simplifies the task considerably. The echo X adds an X to the end of the variable string so that any trailing whitespace in the filename doesn't get eaten, and the parameter substitution ${VAR%X} at the end of the line gets rid of the X. Because readlink adds a newline of its own (which would normally be eaten in the command substitution if not for our previous trickery), we have to get rid of that, too. This is most easily accomplished using the $'' quoting scheme, which lets us use escape sequences such as \\n to represent newlines (this is also how you can easily make deviously named directories and files).The above should cover your needs for locating the currently running script on Linux, but if you don't have the proc filesystem at your disposal, or if you're trying to locate the fully resolved path of some other file, then maybe you'll find the below code helpful. It's only a slight modification from the above one-liner. If you're playing around with strange directory/filenames, checking the output with both ls and readlink is informative, as ls will output \"simplified\" paths, substituting ? for things like newlines.",

                "Here is a summary of ways to call external programs, including their advantages and disadvantages:os.system passes the command and arguments to your system's shell. This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection. For example:However, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, et cetera. On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.os.popen will do the same thing as os.system except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process. There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently. If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don't need to worry about escaping anything. Example:subprocess.Popen. This is intended as a replacement for os.popen, but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive. For example, you'd say:instead ofbut it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions. See the documentation.subprocess.call. This is basically just like the Popen class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code. For example:subprocess.run. Python 3.5+ only. Similar to the above but even more flexible and returns a CompletedProcess object when the command finishes executing.os.fork, os.exec, os.spawn are similar to their C language counterparts, but I don't recommend using them directly.The subprocess module should probably be what you use.Finally, please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. There are serious security implications if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:and imagine that the user enters something \"my mama didnt love me && rm -rf /\" which could erase the whole filesystem.",

                "There are lots of different libraries which allow you to call external commands with Python. For each library I've given a description and shown an example of calling an external command. The command I used as the example is ls -l (list all files). If you want to find out more about any of the libraries I've listed and linked the documentation for each of them.Hopefully this will help you make a decision on which library to use :)Subprocess allows you to call external commands and connect them to their input/output/error pipes (stdin, stdout, and stderr). Subprocess is the default choice for running commands, but sometimes other modules are better.os is used for \"operating system dependent functionality\". It can also be used to call external commands with os.system and os.popen (Note: There is also a subprocess.popen). os will always run the shell and is a simple alternative for people who don't need to, or don't know how to use subprocess.run.sh is a subprocess interface which lets you call programs as if they were functions. This is useful if you want to run a command multiple times.plumbum is a library for \"script-like\" Python programs. You can call programs like functions as in sh. Plumbum is useful if you want to run a pipeline without the shell.pexpect lets you spawn child applications, control them and find patterns in their output. This is a better alternative to subprocess for commands that expect a tty on Unix.fabric is a Python 2.5 and 2.7 library. It allows you to execute local and remote shell commands. Fabric is simple alternative for running commands in a secure shell (SSH)envoy is known as \"subprocess for humans\". It is used as a convenience wrapper around the subprocess module.commands contains wrapper functions for os.popen, but it has been removed from Python 3 since subprocess is a better alternative.",
                "Use the subprocess module (Python 3):It is the recommended standard way. However, more complicated tasks (pipes, output, input, etc.) can be tedious to construct and write.Note on Python version: If you are still using Python 2, subprocess.call works in a similar way.ProTip: shlex.split can help you to parse the command for run, call, and other subprocess functions in case you don't want (or you can't!) provide them in form of lists:If you do not mind external dependencies, use plumbum:It is the best subprocess wrapper. It's cross-platform, i.e. it works on both Windows and Unix-like systems. Install by pip install plumbum.Another popular library is sh:However, sh dropped Windows support, so it's not as awesome as it used to be. Install by pip install sh.",

For more advanced use cases, the underlying Popen interface can be used directly.Here's an example of the simplest possible usage - and it does exactly as asked:run waits for the command to successfully finish, then returns a CompletedProcess object. It may instead raise TimeoutExpired (if you give it a timeout= argument) or CalledProcessError (if it fails and you pass check=True).As you might infer from the above example, stdout and stderr both get piped to your own stdout and stderr by default.We can inspect the returned object and see the command that was given and the returncode:If you want to capture the output, you can pass subprocess.PIPE to the appropriate stderr or stdout:And those respective attributes return bytes.One might easily move from manually providing a command string (like the question suggests) to providing a string built programmatically. Don't build strings programmatically. This is a potential security issue. It's better to assume you don't trust the input.Note, only args should be passed positionally.Here's the actual signature in the source and as shown by help(run):The popenargs and kwargs are given to the Popen constructor. input can be a string of bytes (or unicode, if specify encoding or universal_newlines=True) that will be piped to the subprocess's stdin.The documentation describes timeout= and check=True better than I could:The timeout argument is passed to Popen.communicate(). If the timeout\nexpires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The\nTimeoutExpired exception will be re-raised after the child process has\nterminated.If check is true, and the process exits with a non-zero exit code, a\nCalledProcessError exception will be raised. Attributes of that\nexception hold the arguments, the exit code, and stdout and stderr if\nthey were captured.and this example for check=True is better than one I could come up with:Here's an expanded signature, as given in the documentation:Note that this indicates that only the args list should be passed positionally. So pass the remaining arguments as keyword arguments.When use Popen instead? I would struggle to find use-case based on the arguments alone. Direct usage of Popen would, however, give you access to its methods, including poll, 'send_signal', 'terminate', and 'wait'.Here's the Popen signature as given in the source. I think this is the most precise encapsulation of the information (as opposed to help(Popen)):But more informative is the Popen documentation:Execute a child program in a new process. On POSIX, the class uses\nos.execvp()-like behavior to execute the child program. On Windows,\nthe class uses the Windows CreateProcess() function. The arguments to\nPopen are as follows.Understanding the remaining documentation on Popen will be left as an exercise for the reader.",

                "The strict equality operator (===) behaves identically to the abstract equality operator (==) except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.Reference: Javascript Tutorial: Comparison OperatorsThe == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions.  The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. Both are equally quick.To quote Douglas Crockford's excellent JavaScript: The Good Parts,JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces true and !== produces false.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use === and !==.  All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.A good point was brought up by @Casebash in the comments and in @Phillipe Laybaert's answer concerning objects.  For objects, == and === act consistently with one another (except in a special case).The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its toString or valueOf method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the String constructor.Here the == operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning true, but the === is seeing that they're not the same type and returning false.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you're trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the String constructor to create string objects from string literals.Reference\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3",
                "This is because the equality operator == does type coercion, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.On the other hand, the identity operator === does not do type coercion, and thus does not convert the values when comparing.",
                "Here's an interesting visualisation of the equality comparison between == and ===.Source: https://github.com/dorey/JavaScript-Equality-Table (demo, unified demo)When using === for JavaScript equality testing, everything is as is.\nNothing gets converted before being evaluated.When using == for JavaScript equality testing, some funky conversions take place.Always use ===, unless you fully understand the funky conversions that take place with ==.",
                "In the answers here, I didn't read anything about what equal means. Some will say that === means equal and of the same type, but that's not really true. It actually means that both operands reference the same object, or in case of value types, have the same value.So, let's take the following code:The same here:Or even:This behavior is not always obvious. There's more to the story than being equal and being of the same type.The rule is:For value types (numbers):\na === b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same typeFor reference types:\na === b returns true if a and b reference the exact same objectFor strings:\na === b returns true if a and b are both strings and contain the exact same charactersStrings are not value types, but in Javascript they behave like value types, so they will be \"equal\" when the characters in the string are the same and when they are of the same length (as explained in the third rule)Now it becomes interesting:But how about this?:I thought strings behave like value types? Well, it depends who you ask... In this case a and b are not the same type. a is of type Object, while b is of type string. Just remember that creating a string object using the String constructor creates something of type Object that behaves as a string most of the time.",
                "Let me add this counsel:If in doubt, read the specification!ECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why new String(\"a\") !== \"a\".Please let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let's continue.Searching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: 11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === ), and after wading through the specificationalese I find:11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm\nThe comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. Such a comparison is performed as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a01. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false.\n\u00a0\u00a02. If Type(x) is Undefined, return true.\n\u00a0\u00a03. If Type(x) is Null, return true.\n\u00a0\u00a04. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.\n\u00a0\u00a05. If x is NaN, return false.\n\u00a0\u00a06. If y is NaN, return false.\n\u00a0\u00a07. If x is the same number value as y, return true.\n\u00a0\u00a08. If x is +0 and y is \u22120, return true.\n\u00a0\u00a09. If x is \u22120 and y is +0, return true.\n\u00a0\u00a010. Return false.\n\u00a0\u00a011. If Type(x) is String, then return true if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return false.\n\u00a0\u00a012. If Type(x) is Boolean, return true if x and y are both true or both false; otherwise, return false.\n\u00a0\u00a013. Return true if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return false.Interesting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why new String(\"a\") !== \"a\". Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?Not so fast!Let's check the types of the operands.

Servers MUST be able to handle\nthe URI of any resource they    serve,\nand SHOULD be able to handle URIs of\nunbounded length if they    provide\nGET-based forms that could generate\nsuch URIs. A server    SHOULD return\n414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a\nURI is longer    than the server can\nhandle (see section 10.4.15).That RFC has been obsoleted by RFC7230 which is a refresh of the HTTP/1.1 specification. It contains similar language, but also goes on to suggest this:Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in\npractice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients\nsupport, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.That's what the standards say. For the reality, there was an article on boutell.com (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:Extremely long URLs are usually a\nmistake. URLs over 2,000 characters\nwill not work in the most popular web\nbrowsers. Don't use them if you intend\nyour site to work for the majority of\nInternet users.(Note: this is a quote from an article written in 2006, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs do work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars, and it seems IE9 has a similar limit.I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can click a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.There's a nice writeup on the IE Internals blog which goes into some of the background to this.There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.Be aware that the sitemaps protocol, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you! (see Calin-Andrei Burloiu's answer below)There's also some research from 2010 into the maximum URL length that search engines will crawl and index. They found the limit was 2047 chars, which appears allied to the sitemap protocol spec. However, they also found the Google SERP tool wouldn't cope with URLs longer than 1855 chars.CDNs also impose limits on URI length, and will return a 414 Too long request when these limits are reached, for example:(credit to timrs2998 for providing that info in the comments)I tested the following against an Apache 2.4 server configured with a very large LimitRequestLine and LimitRequestFieldSize.See also this answer from Matas Vaitkevicius below.This is a popular question, and as the original research is ~14 years old I'll try to keep it up to date: As of Jan 2021, the advice still stands.

                "TL;DRYour best bets are usuallySome quick \"don't\"s:But there's lots more to explore, read on...JavaScript has powerful semantics for looping through arrays and array-like objects. I've split the answer into two parts: Options for genuine arrays, and options for things that are just array-like, such as the arguments object, other iterable objects (ES2015+), DOM collections, and so on.Okay, let's look at our options:You have five options (two supported basically forever, another added by ECMAScript\u00a05 [\"ES5\"], and two more added in ECMAScript\u00a02015 (\"ES2015\", aka \"ES6\"):(You can see those old specs here: ES5, ES2015, but both have been superceded; the current editor's draft is always here.)Details:ES2015 added iterators and iterables to JavaScript. Arrays are iterable (so are strings, Maps, and Sets, as well as DOM collections and lists, as you'll see later). Iterable objects provide iterators for their values. The new for-of statement loops through the values returned by an iterator:const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (const element of a) { // You can use `let` instead of `const` if you like\n    console.log(element);\n}\n// a\n// b\n// cIt doesn't get simpler than that! Under the covers, that gets an iterator from the array and loops through the values the iterator returns. The iterator provided by arrays provides the values of the array elements, in order beginning to end.Notice how element is scoped to each loop iteration; trying to use element after the end of the loop would fail because it doesn't exist outside the loop body.In theory, a for-of loop involves several function calls (one to get the iterator, then one to get each value from it). Even when that's true, it's nothing to worry about, function calls are very cheap in modern JavaScript engines (it bothered me for forEach [below] until I looked into it; details). But additionally, JavaScript engines optimize those calls away (in performance-critical code) when dealing with native iterators for things like arrays.for-of is entirely async-friendly. If you need the work in a loop body to be done in series (not in parallel), an await in the loop body will wait for the promise to settle before continuing. Here's a silly example:function delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\n    for (const message of messages) {\n        await delay(400);\n        console.log(message);\n    }\n}\n\nshowSlowly([\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\n]);\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsNote how the words appear with a delay before each one.It's a matter of coding style, but for-of is the first thing I reach for when looping through anything iterable.In any even vaguely-modern environment (so, not IE8) where you have access to the Array features added by ES5, you can use forEach (spec | MDN) if you're only dealing with synchronous code (or you don't need to wait for an asynchronous process to finish during the loop):const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\na.forEach((element) => {\n    console.log(element);\n});forEach accepts a callback function and, optionally, a value to use as this when calling that callback (not used above). The callback is called for each element in the array, in order, skipping non-existent elements in sparse arrays. Although I only used one parameter above, the callback is called with three arguments: The element for that iteration, the index of that element, and a reference to the array you're iterating over (in case your function doesn't already have it handy).Like for-of, forEach has the advantage that you don't have to declare indexing and value variables in the containing scope; in this case, they're supplied as arguments to the iteration function, and so nicely scoped to just that iteration.Unlike for-of, forEach has the disadvantage that it doesn't understand async functions and await. If you use an async function as the callback, forEach does not wait for that function's promise to settle before continuing. Here's the async example from for-of using forEach instead\u00a0\u2014 notice how there's an initial delay, but then all the text appears right away instead of waiting:function delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\n    // INCORRECT, doesn't wait before continuing,\n    // doesn't handle promise rejections\n    messages.forEach(async message => {\n        await delay(400);\n        console.log(message);\n    });\n}\n\nshowSlowly([\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\n]);\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsforEach is the \"loop through them all\" function, but ES5 defined several other useful \"work your way through the array and do things\" functions, including:As with forEach, if you use an async function as your callback, none of those waits for the function's promise to settle. That means:Sometimes the old ways are the best:const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (let index = 0; index < a.length; ++index) {\n    const element = a[index];\n    console.log(element);\n}If the length of the array won't change during the loop, and it's in highly performance-sensitive code, a slightly more complicated version grabbing the length up front might be a tiny bit faster:const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (let index = 0, len = a.length; index < len; ++index) {\n    const element = a[index];\n    console.log(element);\n}And/or counting backward:const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (let index = a.length - 1; index >= 0; --index) {\n    const element = a[index];\n    console.log(element);\n}But with modern JavaScript engines, it's rare you need to eke out that last bit of juice.Before ES2015, the loop variable had to exist in the containing scope, because var only has function-level scope, not block-level scope. But as you saw in the examples above, you can use let within the for to scope the variables to just the loop. And when you do that, the index variable is recreated for each loop iteration, meaning closures created in the loop body keep a reference to the index for that specific iteration, which solves the old \"closures in loops\" problem:// (The `NodeList` from `querySelectorAll` is array-like)\nconst divs = document.querySelectorAll(\"div\");\nfor (let index = 0; index < divs.length; ++index) {\n    divs[index].addEventListener('click', e => {\n        console.log(\"Index is: \" + index);\n    });\n}\n<div>zero</div>\n<div>one</div>\n<div>two</div>\n<div>three</div>\n<div>four</div>In the above, you get \"Index is: 0\" if you click the first and \"Index is: 4\" if you click the last. This does not work if you use var instead of let (you'd always see \"Index is: 5\").Like for-of, for loops work well in async functions. Here's the earlier example using a for loop:function delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; ++i) {\n        const message = messages[i];\n        await delay(400);\n        console.log(message);\n    }\n}\n\nshowSlowly([\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\n]);\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsfor-in isn't for looping through arrays, it's for looping through the names of an object's properties. It does often seem to work for looping through arrays as a by-product of the fact that arrays are objects, but it doesn't just loop through the array indexes, it loops through all enumerable properties of the object (including inherited ones). (It also used to be that the order wasn't specified; it is now [details in this other answer], but even though the order is specified now, the rules are complex, there are exceptions, and relying on the order is not best practice.)The only real use cases for for-in on an array are:Looking only at that first example: You can use for-in to visit those sparse array elements if you use appropriate safeguards:// `a` is a sparse array\nconst a = [];\na[0] = \"a\";\na[10] = \"b\";\na[10000] = \"c\";\nfor (const name in a) {\n    if (Object.hasOwn(a, name) &&       // These checks are\n        /^0$|^[1-9]\\d*$/.test(name) &&  // explained\n        name <= 4294967294              // below\n       ) {\n        const element = a[name];\n        console.log(a[name]);\n    }\n}Note the three checks:That the object has its own property by that name (not one it inherits from its prototype; this check is also often written as a.hasOwnProperty(name) but ES2022 adds Object.hasOwn which can be more reliable), andThat the name is all decimal digits (e.g., normal string form, not scientific notation), andThat the name's value when coerced to a number is <= 2^32 - 2 (which is 4,294,967,294). Where does that number come from? It's part of the definition of an array index in the specification. Other numbers (non-integers, negative numbers, numbers greater than 2^32 - 2) are not array indexes. The reason it's 2^32 - 2 is that that makes the greatest index value one lower than 2^32 - 1, which is the maximum value an array's length can have. (E.g., an array's length fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer.)...although with that said, most code only does the hasOwnProperty check.You wouldn't do that in inline code, of course. You'd write a utility function. Perhaps:// Utility function for antiquated environments without `forEach`\nconst hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call.bind(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty);\nconst rexNum = /^0$|^[1-9]\\d*$/;\nfunction sparseEach(array, callback, thisArg) {\n    for (const name in array) {\n        const index = +name;\n        if (hasOwn(a, name) &&\n            rexNum.test(name) &&\n            index <= 4294967294\n           ) {\n            callback.call(thisArg, array[name], index, array);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nconst a = [];\na[5] = \"five\";\na[10] = \"ten\";\na[100000] = \"one hundred thousand\";\na.b = \"bee\";\n\nsparseEach(a, (value, index) => {\n    console.log(\"Value at \" + index + \" is \" + value);\n});Like for, for-in works well in asynchronous functions if the work within it needs to be done in series.function delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\n    for (const name in messages) {\n        if (messages.hasOwnProperty(name)) { // Almost always this is the only check people do\n            const message = messages[name];\n            await delay(400);\n            console.log(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nshowSlowly([\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\n]);\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsfor-of uses an iterator implicitly, doing all the scut work for you. Sometimes, you might want to use an iterator explicitly. It looks like this:const a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nconst it = a.values(); // Or `const it = a[Symbol.iterator]();` if you like\nlet entry;\nwhile (!(entry = it.next()).done) {\n    const element = entry.value;\n    console.log(element);\n}An iterator is an object matching the Iterator definition in the specification. Its next method returns a new result object each time you call it. The result object has a property, done, telling us whether it's done, and a property value with the value for that iteration. (done is optional if it would be false, value is optional if it would be undefined.)What you get for value varies depending on the iterator. On arrays, the default iterator provides the value of each array element (\"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" in the example earlier). Arrays also have three other methods that return iterators:Since iterator objects don't advance until you call next, they work well in async function loops. Here's the earlier for-of example using the iterator explicitly:function delay(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nasync function showSlowly(messages) {\n    const it = messages.values()\n    while (!(entry = it.next()).done) {\n        await delay(400);\n        const element = entry.value;\n        console.log(element);\n    }\n}\n\nshowSlowly([\n    \"So\", \"long\", \"and\", \"thanks\", \"for\", \"all\", \"the\", \"fish!\"\n]);\n// `.catch` omitted because we know it never rejectsAside from true arrays, there are also array-like objects that have a length property and properties with all-digits names: NodeList instances, HTMLCollection instances, the arguments object, etc. How do we loop through their contents?At least some, and possibly most or even all, of the array approaches above apply equally well to array-like objects:Use for-of (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)for-of uses the iterator provided by the object (if any). That includes host-provided objects (like DOM collections and lists). For instance, HTMLCollection instances from getElementsByXYZ methods and NodeLists instances from querySelectorAll both support iteration. (This is defined quite subtly by the HTML and DOM specifications. Basically, any object with length and indexed access is automatically iterable. It doesn't have to be marked iterable; that is used only for collections that, in addition to being iterable, support forEach, values, keys, and entries methods. NodeList does; HTMLCollection doesn't, but both are iterable.)Here's an example of looping through div elements:const divs = document.querySelectorAll(\"div\");\nfor (const div of divs) {\n    div.textContent = Math.random();\n}\n<div>zero</div>\n<div>one</div>\n<div>two</div>\n<div>three</div>\n<div>four</div>Use forEach and related (ES5+)The various functions on Array.prototype are \"intentionally generic\" and can be used on array-like objects via Function#call (spec | MDN) or Function#apply (spec | MDN). (If you have to deal with IE8 or earlier [ouch], see the \"Caveat for host-provided objects\" at the end of this answer, but it's not an issue with vaguely-modern browsers.)Suppose you wanted to use forEach on a Node's childNodes collection (which, being an HTMLCollection, doesn't have forEach natively). You'd do this:(Note, though, that you could just use for-of on node.childNodes.)If you're going to do that a lot, you might want to grab a copy of the function reference into a variable for reuse, e.g.:Use a simple for loopPerhaps obviously, a simple for loop works for array-like objects.Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)See #1.You may be able to get away with for-in (with safeguards), but with all of these more appropriate options, there's no reason to try.Other times, you may want to convert an array-like object into a true array. Doing that is surprisingly easy:Use Array.fromArray.from (spec) | (MDN) (ES2015+, but easily polyfilled) creates an array from an array-like object, optionally passing the entries through a mapping function first. So:...takes the NodeList from querySelectorAll and makes an array from it.The mapping function is handy if you were going to map the contents in some way. For instance, if you wanted to get an array of the tag names of the elements with a given class:Use spread syntax (...)It's also possible to use ES2015's spread syntax. Like for-of, this uses the iterator provided by the object (see #1 in the previous section):So for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, with spread syntax this becomes quite succinct:Use the slice method of arraysWe can use the slice method of arrays, which like the other methods mentioned above is \"intentionally generic\" and so can be used with array-like objects, like this:So for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, we could do this:(If you still have to handle IE8 [ouch], will fail; IE8 didn't let you use host-provided objects as this like that.)If you use Array.prototype functions with host-provided array-like objects (for example, DOM collections and such provided by the browser rather than the JavaScript engine), obsolete browsers like IE8 didn't necessarily handle that way, so if you have to support them, be sure to test in your target environments. But it's not an issue with vaguely-modern browsers. (For non-browser environments, naturally it'll depend on the environment.)",
                "Note: This answer is hopelessly out-of-date. For a more modern approach, look at the methods available on an array. Methods of interest might be:The standard way to iterate an array in JavaScript is a vanilla for-loop:Note, however, that this approach is only good if you have a dense array, and each index is occupied by an element. If the array is sparse, then you can run into performance problems with this approach, since you will iterate over a lot of indices that do not really exist in the array. In this case, a for .. in-loop might be a better idea. However, you must use the appropriate safeguards to ensure that only the desired properties of the array (that is, the array elements) are acted upon, since the for..in-loop will also be enumerated in legacy browsers, or if the additional properties are defined as enumerable.In ECMAScript 5 there will be a forEach method on the array prototype, but it is not supported in legacy browsers. So to be able to use it consistently you must either have an environment that supports it (for example, Node.js for server side JavaScript), or use a \"Polyfill\". The Polyfill for this functionality is, however, trivial and since it makes the code easier to read, it is a good polyfill to include.",

                "I think the reverse for loop deserves a mention here:Some developers use the reverse for loop by default, unless there is a good reason to loop forwards.Although the performance gains are usually insignificant, it sort of screams:\"Just do this to every item in the list, I don't care about the order!\"However in practice that is not actually a reliable indication of intent, since it is indistinguishable from those occasions when you do care about the order, and really do need to loop in reverse.  So in fact another construct would be needed to accurately express the \"don't care\" intent, something currently unavailable in most languages, including ECMAScript, but which could be called, for example, forEachUnordered().If order doesn't matter, and efficiency is a concern (in the innermost loop of a game or animation engine), then it may be acceptable to use the reverse for loop as your go-to pattern.  Just remember that seeing a reverse for loop in existing code does not necessarily mean that the order irrelevant!In general for higher level code where clarity and safety are greater concerns, I previously recommended using Array::forEach as your default pattern for looping (although these days I prefer to use for..of).  Reasons to prefer forEach over a reverse loop are:Then when you do see the reverse for loop in your code, that is a hint that it is reversed for a good reason (perhaps one of the reasons described above).  And seeing a traditional forward for loop may indicate that shifting can take place.(If the discussion of intent makes no sense to you, then you and your code may benefit from watching Crockford's lecture on Programming Style & Your Brain.)There is a debate about whether for..of or forEach() are preferable:For maximum browser support, for..of requires a polyfill for iterators, making your app slightly slower to execute and slightly larger to download.For that reason (and to encourage use of map and filter), some front-end style guides ban for..of completely!But the above concerns is not applicable to Node.js applications, where for..of is now well supported.And furthermore await does not work inside forEach().  Using for..of is the clearest pattern in this case.Personally, I tend to use whatever looks easiest to read, unless performance or minification has become a major concern.  So these days I prefer to use for..of instead of forEach(), but I will always use map or filter or find or some when applicable. \n (For the sake of my colleagues, I rarely use reduce.)You will notice that i-- is the middle clause (where we usually see a comparison) and the last clause is empty (where we usually see i++).  That means that i-- is also used as the condition for continuation.  Crucially, it is executed and checked before each iteration.How can it start at array.length without exploding?Because i-- runs before each iteration, on the first iteration we will actually be accessing the item at array.length - 1 which avoids any issues with Array-out-of-bounds undefined items.Why doesn't it stop iterating before index 0?The loop will stop iterating when the condition i-- evaluates to a falsey value (when it yields 0).The trick is that unlike --i, the trailing i-- operator decrements i but yields the value before the decrement.  Your console can demonstrate this:> var i = 5; [i, i--, i];[5, 5, 4]So on the final iteration, i was previously 1 and the i-- expression changes it to 0 but actually yields 1 (truthy), and so the condition passes.  On the next iteration i-- changes i to -1 but yields 0 (falsey), causing execution to immediately drop out of the bottom of the loop.In the traditional forwards for loop, i++ and ++i are interchangeable (as Douglas Crockford points out).  However in the reverse for loop, because our decrement is also our condition expression, we must stick with i-- if we want to process the item at index 0.Some people like to draw a little arrow in the reverse for loop, and end with a wink:Credits go to WYL for showing me the benefits and horrors of the reverse for loop.",

                "When iterating over an array, we often want to accomplish one of the following goals:We want to iterate over the array and create a new array:Array.prototype.mapWe want to iterate over the array and don't create a new array:Array.prototype.forEach \nfor..of loopIn JavaScript, there are many ways of accomplishing both of these goals. However, some are more convenient than others. Below you can find some commonly used methods (the most convenient IMO) to accomplish array iteration in JavaScript.map() is a function located on Array.prototype which can transform every element of an array and then returns a new array. map() takes as an argument a callback function and works in the following manner:let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nlet newArr = arr.map((element, index, array) => {\r\n  return element * 2;\r\n})\r\n\r\nconsole.log(arr);\r\nconsole.log(newArr);The callback which we have passed into map() as an argument gets executed for every element. Then an array gets returned which has the same length as the original array. In this new array element is transformed by the callback function passed in as an argument to map().The distinct difference between map and another loop mechanism like forEach and a for..of loop is that map returns a new array and leaves the old array intact (except if you explicitly manipulate it with thinks like splice).Also, note that the map function's callback provides the index number of the current iteration as a second argument. Furthermore, does the third argument provide the array on which map was called? Sometimes these properties can be very useful.forEach is a function which is located on Array.prototype which takes a callback function as an argument. It then executes this callback function for every element in the array. In contrast to the map() function, the forEach function returns nothing (undefined). For example:let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n\r\narr.forEach((element, index, array) => {\r\n\r\n  console.log(element * 2);\r\n\r\n  if (index === 4) {\r\n    console.log(array)\r\n  }\r\n  // index, and oldArray are provided as 2nd and 3th argument by the callback\r\n\r\n})\r\n\r\nconsole.log(arr);Just like the map function, the forEach callback provides the index number of the current iteration as a second argument. Also, does the third argument provide the array on which forEach was called?The for..of loop loops through every element of an array (or any other iterable object). It works in the following manner:let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nfor(let element of arr) {\r\n  console.log(element * 2);\r\n}In the above example, element stands for an array element and arr is the array which we want to loop. Note that the name element is arbitrary, and we could have picked any other name like 'el' or something more declarative when this is applicable.Don't confuse the for..in loop with the for..of loop. for..in will loop through all enumerable properties of the array whereas the for..of loop will only loop through the array elements. For example:let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n\r\narr.foo = 'foo';\r\n\r\nfor(let element of arr) {\r\n  console.log(element);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor(let element in arr) {\r\n  console.log(element);\r\n}",
                "Today (2019-12-18) I perform test on my macOS v10.13.6 (High Sierra), on Chrome v 79.0, Safari v13.0.4 and Firefox v71.0 (64 bit) - conclusions about optimisation (and micro-optimisation which usually is not worth to introduce it to code because the benefit is small, but code complexity grows).It looks like the traditional for i (Aa) is a good choice to write fast code on all browsers.The other solutions, like for-of (Ad), all in group C.... are usually 2 - 10 (and more) times slower than Aa, but for small arrays it is ok to use it - for the sake of increase code clarity.The loops with array length cached in n (Ab, Bb, Be) are sometimes faster, sometimes not. Probably compilers automatically detect this situation and introduce caching. The speed differences between the cached and no-cached versions (Aa, Ba, Bd) are about ~1%, so it looks like introduce n is a micro-optimisation.The i-- like solutions where the loop starts from the last array element (Ac, Bc) are usually ~30% slower than forward solutions - probably the reason is the way of CPU memory cache working - forward memory reading is more optimal for CPU caching). Is recommended to NOT USE such solutions.In tests we calculate the sum of array elements.

                "We'll assume you already know how to build a login+password HTML form which POSTs the values to a script on the server side for authentication. The sections below will deal with patterns for sound practical auth, and how to avoid the most common security pitfalls.To HTTPS or not to HTTPS?Unless the connection is already secure (that is, tunneled through HTTPS using SSL/TLS), your login form values will be sent in cleartext, which allows anyone eavesdropping on the line between browser and web server will be able to read logins as they pass through. This type of wiretapping is done routinely by governments, but in general, we won't address 'owned' wires other than to say this: Just use HTTPS.In essence, the only practical way to protect against wiretapping/packet sniffing during login is by using HTTPS or another certificate-based encryption scheme (for example, TLS) or a proven & tested challenge-response scheme (for example, the Diffie-Hellman-based SRP). Any other method can be easily circumvented by an eavesdropping attacker.Of course, if you are willing to get a little bit impractical, you could also employ some form of two-factor authentication scheme (e.g. the Google Authenticator app, a physical 'cold war style' codebook, or an RSA key generator dongle). If applied correctly, this could work even with an unsecured connection, but it's hard to imagine that a dev would be willing to implement two-factor auth but not SSL.(Do not) Roll-your-own JavaScript encryption/hashingGiven the perceived (though now avoidable) cost and technical difficulty of setting up an SSL certificate on your website, some developers are tempted to roll their own in-browser hashing or encryption schemes in order to avoid passing cleartext logins over an unsecured wire.While this is a noble thought, it is essentially useless (and can be a security flaw) unless it is combined with one of the above - that is, either securing the line with strong encryption or using a tried-and-tested challenge-response mechanism (if you don't know what that is, just know that it is one of the most difficult to prove, most difficult to design, and most difficult to implement concepts in digital security).While it is true that hashing the password can be effective against password disclosure, it is vulnerable to replay attacks, Man-In-The-Middle attacks / hijackings (if an attacker can inject a few bytes into your unsecured HTML page before it reaches your browser, they can simply comment out the hashing in the JavaScript), or brute-force attacks (since you are handing the attacker both username, salt and hashed password).CAPTCHAS against humanityCAPTCHA is meant to thwart one specific category of attack: automated dictionary/brute force trial-and-error with no human operator. There is no doubt that this is a real threat, however, there are ways of dealing with it seamlessly that don't require a CAPTCHA, specifically properly designed server-side login throttling schemes - we'll discuss those later.Know that CAPTCHA implementations are not created alike; they often aren't human-solvable, most of them are actually ineffective against bots, all of them are ineffective against cheap third-world labor (according to OWASP, the current sweatshop rate is $12 per 500 tests), and some implementations may be technically illegal in some countries (see OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet). If you must use a CAPTCHA, use Google's reCAPTCHA, since it is OCR-hard by definition (since it uses already OCR-misclassified book scans) and tries very hard to be user-friendly.Personally, I tend to find CAPTCHAS annoying, and use them only as a last resort when a user has failed to log in a number of times and throttling delays are maxed out. This will happen rarely enough to be acceptable, and it strengthens the system as a whole.Storing Passwords / Verifying loginsThis may finally be common knowledge after all the highly-publicized hacks and user data leaks we've seen in recent years, but it has to be said: Do not store passwords in cleartext in your database. User databases are routinely hacked, leaked or gleaned through SQL injection, and if you are storing raw, plaintext passwords, that is instant game over for your login security.So if you can't store the password, how do you check that the login+password combination POSTed from the login form is correct? The answer is hashing using a key derivation function. Whenever a new user is created or a password is changed, you take the password and run it through a KDF, such as Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2, turning the cleartext password (\"correcthorsebatterystaple\") into a long, random-looking string, which is a lot safer to store in your database. To verify a login, you run the same hash function on the entered password, this time passing in the salt and compare the resulting hash string to the value stored in your database. Argon2, bcrypt and scrypt store the salt with the hash already. Check out this article on sec.stackexchange for more detailed information.The reason a salt is used is that hashing in itself is not sufficient -- you'll want to add a so-called 'salt' to protect the hash against rainbow tables. A salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value, preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack.A cryptographic hash should not be used for password storage because user-selected passwords are not strong enough (i.e. do not usually contain enough entropy) and a password guessing attack could be completed in a relatively short time by an attacker with access to the hashes. This is why KDFs are used - these effectively \"stretch the key\", which means that every password guess an attacker makes causes multiple repetitions of the hash algorithm, for example 10,000 times, which causes the attacker to guess the password 10,000 times slower.Session data - \"You are logged in as Spiderman69\"Once the server has verified the login and password against your user database and found a match, the system needs a way to remember that the browser has been authenticated. This fact should only ever be stored server side in the session data.If you are unfamiliar with session data, here's how it works: A single randomly-generated string is stored in an expiring cookie and used to reference a collection of data - the session data - which is stored on the server. If you are using an MVC framework, this is undoubtedly handled already.If at all possible, make sure the session cookie has the secure and HTTP Only flags set when sent to the browser. The HttpOnly flag provides some protection against the cookie being read through XSS attack. The secure flag ensures that the cookie is only sent back via HTTPS, and therefore protects against network sniffing attacks. The value of the cookie should not be predictable. Where a cookie referencing a non-existent session is presented, its value should be replaced immediately to prevent session fixation.Session state can also be maintained on the client side. This is achieved by using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Token).Persistent Login Cookies (\"remember me\" functionality) are a danger zone; on the one hand, they are entirely as safe as conventional logins when users understand how to handle them; and on the other hand, they are an enormous security risk in the hands of careless users, who may use them on public computers and forget to log out, and who may not know what browser cookies are or how to delete them.Personally, I like persistent logins for the websites I visit on a regular basis, but I know how to handle them safely. If you are positive that your users know the same, you can use persistent logins with a clean conscience. If not - well, then you may subscribe to the philosophy that users who are careless with their login credentials brought it upon themselves if they get hacked. It's not like we go to our user's houses and tear off all those facepalm-inducing Post-It notes with passwords they have lined up on the edge of their monitors, either.Of course, some systems can't afford to have any accounts hacked; for such systems, there is no way you can justify having persistent logins.If you DO decide to implement persistent login cookies, this is how you do it:First, take some time to read Paragon Initiative's article on the subject. You'll need to get a bunch of elements right, and the article does a great job of explaining each.And just to reiterate one of the most common pitfalls, DO NOT STORE THE PERSISTENT LOGIN COOKIE (TOKEN) IN YOUR DATABASE, ONLY A HASH OF IT! The login token is Password Equivalent, so if an attacker got their hands on your database, they could use the tokens to log in to any account, just as if they were cleartext login-password combinations. Therefore, use hashing (according to https://security.stackexchange.com/a/63438/5002 a weak hash will do just fine for this purpose) when storing persistent login tokens.Don't implement 'secret questions'. The 'secret questions' feature is a security anti-pattern. Read the paper from link number 4 from the MUST-READ list. You can ask Sarah Palin about that one, after her Yahoo! email account got hacked during a previous presidential campaign because the answer to her security question was... \"Wasilla High School\"!Even with user-specified questions, it is highly likely that most users will choose either:A 'standard' secret question like mother's maiden name or favorite petA simple piece of trivia that anyone could lift from their blog, LinkedIn profile, or similarAny question that is easier to answer than guessing their password. Which, for any decent password, is every question you can imagineIn conclusion, security questions are inherently insecure in virtually all their forms and variations, and should not be employed in an authentication scheme for any reason.The true reason why security questions even exist in the wild is that they conveniently save the cost of a few support calls from users who can't access their email to get to a reactivation code. This at the expense of security and Sarah Palin's reputation. Worth it? Probably not.I already mentioned why you should never use security questions for handling forgotten/lost user passwords; it also goes without saying that you should never e-mail users their actual passwords. There are at least two more all-too-common pitfalls to avoid in this field:Don't reset a forgotten password to an autogenerated strong password - such passwords are notoriously hard to remember, which means the user must either change it or write it down - say, on a bright yellow Post-It on the edge of their monitor. Instead of setting a new password, just let users pick a new one right away - which is what they want to do anyway. (An exception to this might be if the users are universally using a password manager to store/manage passwords that would normally be impossible to remember without writing it down).Always hash the lost password code/token in the database. AGAIN, this code is another example of a Password Equivalent, so it MUST be hashed in case an attacker got their hands on your database. When a lost password code is requested, send the plaintext code to the user's email address, then hash it, save the hash in your database -- and throw away the original. Just like a password or a persistent login token.A final note: always make sure your interface for entering the 'lost password code' is at least as secure as your login form itself, or an attacker will simply use this to gain access instead. Making sure you generate very long 'lost password codes' (for example, 16 case-sensitive alphanumeric characters) is a good start, but consider adding the same throttling scheme that you do for the login form itself.First, you'll want to read this small article for a reality check: The 500 most common passwordsOkay, so maybe the list isn't the canonical list of most common passwords on any system anywhere ever, but it's a good indication of how poorly people will choose their passwords when there is no enforced policy in place. Plus, the list looks frighteningly close to home when you compare it to publicly available analyses of recently stolen passwords.So: With no minimum password strength requirements, 2% of users use one of the top 20 most common passwords. Meaning: if an attacker gets just 20 attempts, 1 in 50 accounts on your website will be crackable.Thwarting this requires calculating the entropy of a password and then applying a threshold.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63 has a set of very good suggestions.  That, when combined with a dictionary and keyboard layout analysis (for example, 'qwertyuiop' is a bad password), can reject 99% of all poorly selected passwords at a level of 18 bits of entropy.  Simply calculating password strength and showing a visual strength meter to a user is good, but insufficient.  Unless it is enforced, a lot of users will most likely ignore it.And for a refreshing take on user-friendliness of high-entropy passwords, Randall Munroe's Password Strength xkcd is highly recommended.Utilize Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned API to check users passwords against passwords compromised in public data breaches.First, have a look at the numbers: Password Recovery Speeds - How long will your password stand upIf you don't have the time to look through the tables in that link, here's the list of them:It takes virtually no time to crack a weak password, even if you're cracking it with an abacusIt takes virtually no time to crack an alphanumeric 9-character password if it is case insensitiveIt takes virtually no time to crack an intricate, symbols-and-letters-and-numbers, upper-and-lowercase password if it is less than 8 characters long (a desktop PC can search the entire keyspace up to 7 characters in a matter of days or even hours)It would, however, take an inordinate amount of time to crack even a 6-character password, if you were limited to one attempt per second!So what can we learn from these numbers? Well, lots, but we can focus on the most important part: the fact that preventing large numbers of rapid-fire successive login attempts (ie. the brute force attack) really isn't that difficult. But preventing it right isn't as easy as it seems.Generally speaking, you have three choices that are all effective against brute-force attacks (and dictionary attacks, but since you are already employing a strong passwords policy, they shouldn't be an issue):Present a CAPTCHA after N failed attempts (annoying as hell and often ineffective -- but I'm repeating myself here)Locking accounts and requiring email verification after N failed attempts (this is a DoS attack waiting to happen)And finally, login throttling: that is, setting a time delay between attempts after N failed attempts (yes, DoS attacks are still possible, but at least they are far less likely and a lot more complicated to pull off).Best practice #1: A short time delay that increases with the number of failed attempts, like:DoS attacking this scheme would be very impractical, since the resulting lockout time is slightly larger than the sum of the previous lockout times.To clarify: The delay is not a delay before returning the response to the browser. It is more like a timeout or refractory period during which login attempts to a specific account or from a specific IP address will not be accepted or evaluated at all. That is, correct credentials will not return in a successful login, and incorrect credentials will not trigger a delay increase.Best practice #2: A medium length time delay that goes into effect after N failed attempts, like:DoS attacking this scheme would be quite impractical, but certainly doable. Also, it might be relevant to note that such a long delay can be very annoying for a legitimate user. Forgetful users will dislike you.Best practice #3: Combining the two approaches - either a fixed, short time delay that goes into effect after N failed attempts, like:Or, an increasing delay with a fixed upper bound, like:This final scheme was taken from the OWASP best-practices suggestions (link 1 from the MUST-READ list) and should be considered best practice, even if it is admittedly on the restrictive side.As a rule of thumb, however, I would say: the stronger your password policy is, the less you have to bug users with delays. If you require strong (case-sensitive alphanumerics + required numbers and symbols) 9+ character passwords, you could give the users 2-4 non-delayed password attempts before activating the throttling.DoS attacking this final login throttling scheme would be very impractical. And as a final touch, always allow persistent (cookie) logins (and/or a CAPTCHA-verified login form) to pass through, so legitimate users won't even be delayed while the attack is in progress. That way, the very impractical DoS attack becomes an extremely impractical attack.Additionally, it makes sense to do more aggressive throttling on admin accounts, since those are the most attractive entry pointsJust as an aside, more advanced attackers will try to circumvent login throttling by 'spreading their activities':Distributing the attempts on a botnet to prevent IP address flaggingRather than picking one user and trying the 50.000 most common passwords (which they can't, because of our throttling), they will pick THE most common password and try it against 50.000 users instead. That way, not only do they get around maximum-attempts measures like CAPTCHAs and login throttling, their chance of success increases as well, since the number 1 most common password is far more likely than number 49.995Spacing the login requests for each user account, say, 30 seconds apart, to sneak under the radarHere, the best practice would be logging the number of failed logins, system-wide, and using a running average of your site's bad-login frequency as the basis for an upper limit that you then impose on all users.Too abstract? Let me rephrase:Say your site has had an average of 120 bad logins per day over the past 3 months. Using that (running average), your system might set the global limit to 3 times that -- ie. 360 failed attempts over a 24 hour period. Then, if the total number of failed attempts across all accounts exceeds that number within one day (or even better, monitor the rate of acceleration and trigger on a calculated threshold), it activates system-wide login throttling - meaning short delays for ALL users (still, with the exception of cookie logins and/or backup CAPTCHA logins).I also posted a question with more details and a really good discussion of how to avoid tricky pitfals in fending off distributed brute force attacksCredentials can be compromised, whether by exploits, passwords being written down and lost, laptops with keys being stolen, or users entering logins into phishing sites.  Logins can be further protected with two-factor authentication, which uses out-of-band factors such as single-use codes received from a phone call, SMS message, app, or dongle. Several providers offer two-factor authentication services.Authentication can be completely delegated to a single-sign-on service, where another provider handles collecting credentials. This pushes the problem to a trusted third party. Google and Twitter both provide standards-based SSO services, while Facebook provides a similar proprietary solution.",
                "The only practical way to send credentials 100% securely is by using SSL. Using JavaScript to hash the password is not safe. Common pitfalls for client-side password hashing:There's another secure method called SRP, but it's patented (although it is freely licensed) and there are few good implementations available.Don't ever store passwords as plaintext in the database. Not even if you don't care about the security of your own site. Assume that some of your users will reuse the password of their online bank account. So, store the hashed password, and throw away the original. And make sure the password doesn't show up in access logs or application logs. OWASP recommends the use of Argon2 as your first choice for new applications. If this is not available, PBKDF2 or scrypt should be used instead. And finally if none of the above are available, use bcrypt.Hashes by themselves are also insecure. For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes--this makes hash lookup tables an effective way of cracking lots of passwords at once. Instead, store the salted hash. A salt is a string appended to the password prior to hashing - use a different (random) salt per user. The salt is a public value, so you can store them with the hash in the database. See here for more on this.This means that you can't send the user their forgotten passwords (because you only have the hash). Don't reset the user's password unless you have authenticated the user (users must prove that they are able to read emails sent to the stored (and validated) email address.)Security questions are insecure - avoid using them. Why? Anything a security question does, a password does better. Read PART III: Using Secret Questions in @Jens Roland answer here in this wiki.After the user logs in, the server sends the user a session cookie. The server can retrieve the username or id from the cookie, but nobody else can generate such a cookie (TODO explain mechanisms).Cookies can be hijacked: they are only as secure as the rest of the client's machine and other communications. They can be read from disk, sniffed in network traffic, lifted by a cross-site scripting attack, phished from a poisoned DNS so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers. Don't send persistent cookies. Cookies should expire at the end of the client session (browser close or leaving your domain).If you want to autologin your users, you can set a persistent cookie, but it should be distinct from a full-session cookie. You can set an additional flag that the user has auto-logged in, and needs to log in for real for sensitive operations. This is popular with shopping sites that want to provide you with a seamless, personalized shopping experience but still protect your financial details. For example, when you return to visit Amazon, they show you a page that looks like you're logged in, but when you go to place an order (or change your shipping address, credit card etc.), they ask you to confirm your password.Financial websites such as banks and credit cards, on the other hand, only have sensitive data and should not allow auto-login or a low-security mode.",
                "First, a strong caveat that this answer is not the best fit for this exact question. It should definitely not be the top answer!I will go ahead and mention Mozilla\u2019s proposed BrowserID (or perhaps more precisely, the Verified Email Protocol) in the spirit of finding an upgrade path to better approaches to authentication in the future.I\u2019ll summarize it this way:This is not strictly \u201cform-based authentication for websites\u201d. But it is an effort to transition from the current norm of form-based authentication to something more secure: browser-supported authentication.",
                "I just thought I'd share this solution that I found to be working just fine.I call it the Dummy Field (though I haven't invented this so don't credit me). Others know this as a honey pot.In short: you just have to insert this into your <form> and check for it to be empty at when validating:The trick is to fool a bot into thinking it has to insert data into a required field, that's why I named the input \"email\". If you already have a field called email that you're using you should try naming the dummy field something else like \"company\", \"phone\" or \"emailaddress\". Just pick something you know you don't need and what sounds like something people would normally find logical to fill in into a web form. Now hide the input field using CSS or JavaScript/jQuery - whatever fits you best - just don't set the input type to hidden or else the bot won't fall for it.When you are validating the form (either client or server side) check if your dummy field has been filled to determine if it was sent by a human or a bot.Example:In case of a human:\nThe user will not see the dummy field (in my case named \"email\") and will not attempt to fill it. So the value of the dummy field should still be empty when the form has been sent.In case of a bot: The bot will see a field whose type is text and a name email (or whatever it is you called it) and will logically attempt to fill it with appropriate data. It doesn't care if you styled the input form with some fancy CSS, web-developers do it all the time. Whatever the value in the dummy field is, we don't care as long as it's larger than 0 characters.I used this method on a guestbook in combination with CAPTCHA, and I haven't seen a single spam post since. I had used a CAPTCHA-only solution before, but eventually, it resulted in about five spam posts every hour. Adding the dummy field in the form has stopped (at least until now) all the spam from appearing.I believe this can also be used just fine with a login/authentication form.Warning: Of course this method is not 100% foolproof. Bots can be programmed to ignore input fields with the style display:none applied to it. You also have to think about people who use some form of auto-completion (like most browsers have built-in!) to auto-fill all form fields for them. They might just as well pick up a dummy field.You can also vary this up a little by leaving the dummy field visible but outside the boundaries of the screen, but this is totally up to you.Be creative!",
                "I do not think the above answer is \"wrong\" but there are large areas of authentication that are not touched upon (or rather the emphasis is on \"how to implement cookie sessions\", not on \"what options are available and what are the trade-offs\".My suggested edits/answers areDo NOT try to implement your own login form or database storage of passwords, unless \nthe data being stored is valueless at account creation and self-generated (that is, web 2.0 style like Facebook, Flickr, etc.)This avoids any need to have \"sessions\" or cookies as the browser itself will re-encrypt the communication each time. It is the most \"lightweight\" development approach.However, I do not recommend this, except for public, low-value services. This is an issue with some of the other answers above - do not try an re-implement server-side authentication mechanisms - this problem has been solved and is supported by most major browsers. Do not use cookies. Do not store anything in your own hand-rolled database. Just ask, per request, if the request is authenticated. Everything else should be supported by configuration and third-party trusted software.So ...First, we are confusing the initial creation of an account (with a password) with the re-checking of the password subsequently. If I am Flickr and creating your site for the first time, the new user has access to zero value (blank web space). I truly do not care if the person creating the account is lying about their name. If I am creating an account of the hospital intranet/extranet, the value lies in all the medical records, and so I do care about the identity (*) of the account creator.This is the very very hard part. The only decent solution is a web of trust. For example, you join the hospital as a doctor. You create a web page hosted somewhere with your photo, your passport number, and a public key, and hash them all with the private key. You then visit the hospital and the system administrator looks at your passport, sees if the photo matches you, and then hashes the web page/photo hash with the hospital private key. From now on we can securely exchange keys and tokens. As can anyone who trusts the hospital (there is the secret sauce BTW). The system administrator can also give you an RSA dongle or other two-factor authentication.But this is a lot of a hassle, and not very web 2.0. However, it is the only secure way to create new accounts that have access to valuable information that is not self-created.Kerberos and SPNEGO - single sign-on mechanisms with a trusted third party - basically the user verifies against a trusted third party. (NB this is not in any way the not to be trusted OAuth)SRP - sort of clever password authentication without a trusted third party. But here we are getting into the realms of \"it's safer to use two-factor authentication, even if that's costlier\"SSL client side - give the clients a public key certificate (support in all major browsers - but raises questions over client machine security).In the end, it's a tradeoff - what is the cost of a security breach vs the cost of implementing more secure approaches. One day, we may see a proper PKI widely accepted and so no more own rolled authentication forms and databases. One day...",

                "I'd like to add one suggestion I've used, based on defense in depth. You don't need to have the same auth&auth system for admins as regular users. You can have a separate login form on a separate url executing separate code for requests that will grant high privileges. This one can make choices that would be a total pain to regular users. One such that I've used is to actually scramble the login URL for admin access and email the admin the new URL. Stops any brute force attack right away as your new URL can be arbitrarily difficult (very long random string) but your admin user's only inconvenience is following a link in their email.
